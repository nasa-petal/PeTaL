Despite having a name that appears to derive from the Spanish term for the plant genus Juncus (rushes), these birds are seldom found among rush plants, as these prefer wet ground, while juncos like dry soil.\nTheir breeding habitat is coniferous or mixed forest areas throughout North America, ranging from subarctic taiga to high-altitude mountain forests in Mexico and Central America south to Panama. Northern birds usually migrate farther south; southern populations are permanent residents or altitudinal migrants, moving only a short distance downslope to avoid severe winter weather in the mountains.\nThese birds forage on the ground.

The name Pipilo is New Latin for "bunting" from pipilare "to chirp".There has been considerable debate over the taxonomy of towhees in recent years. Two species complexes have been identified, the rufous-sided complex (involving Pipilo erythrophthalmus, P. maculatus, P. socorroensis, P. ocai and P. chlorurus), and the brown towhee complex (involving Melozone crissalis, M. fuscus, M. aberti and M. albicollis). The distinction of species within these is uncertain and opinions have differed over the years. Modern authorities distinguish all four species in the brown towhee complex, though M. fuscus and M. crissalis were formerly treated as a single species.

Two other populations have since been discovered, on the island of Cayo Coco in Camag\xfcey Province and in a coastal region in Guant\xe1namo Province. As the species is no longer confined to Zapata the alternative name of Cuban sparrow is sometimes suggested.\nEach population is assigned to a different race due to differences in plumage and ecology.
