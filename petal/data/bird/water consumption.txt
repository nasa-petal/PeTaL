Carbon dynamics of <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> seedlings under drought and complete darkness
<p>Carbon (C) storage is considered a key component to plant survival under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and shade, although the combined effects of these factors on survival remain poorly understood. We investigated how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and shade alter the C dynamics and survival of tree seedlings, and whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> limits the access to or usage of stored C. We experimentally applied two levels of soil humidity (well-watered versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, the latter induced by dry-down) and light availability (light versus complete darkness) on 1-year-old seedlings of <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> L. for 3 months. We quantified the survival, biomass, growth rate and non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) of seedlings at their time of death or at the end of the experiment for those that survived. We found that the soil dried out faster when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> was combined with light than when it was combined with complete darkness. Seedlings subjected to both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and light showed reduced growth and reached 100% mortality earlier than any other treatment, with the highest NSC concentrations at the time of death. Seedlings exposed to both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and complete darkness died significantly earlier than seedlings exposed to complete darkness only, but had similar NSC concentrations at time of their death, suggesting that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> accelerated the use of stored C under complete darkness. Complete darkness significantly reduced seedling growth and whole-plant NSC concentrations regardless of soil humidity, while root NSC concentrations were significantly more reduced when complete darkness was combined with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> conditions. Thus, the C dynamics in <i>A. pseudoplatanus</i> seedlings under complete darkness was not hindered by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, i.e., the access and use of stored C was not limited by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>. The contrasting growth and C storage responses driven by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> under light versus complete darkness are consistent with a key role of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> progression in the C dynamics of trees.</p>

The Accumulation of miRNAs Differentially Modulated by Drought Stress Is Affected by Grafting in Grapevine
<p>Grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is routinely grafted, and rootstocks inducing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance represent a source for adapting vineyards to climate change in temperate areas. Our goal was to investigate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress effects on microRNA (miRNA) abundance in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-resistant grapevine rootstock, M4 (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> × <i>Vitis berlandieri</i>), compared with a commercial cultivar, Cabernet Sauvignon, using their autografts and reciprocal grafts. RNA extracted from roots and leaves of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>ed and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irrig</span></strong>ated plants of different graft combinations was used to prepare cDNA libraries for small RNA sequencing and to analyze miRNAs by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Measurements of leaf water potential, leaf gas exchange, and root hydraulic conductance attested that, under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irrig</span></strong>ation, M4 reduced water loss in comparison with cultivar Cabernet Sauvignon mostly through nonhydraulic, root-specific mechanisms. Under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, stomatal conductance decreased at similar levels in the two genotypes. Small RNA sequencing allowed the identification of 70 conserved miRNAs and the prediction of 28 novel miRNAs. Different accumulation trends of miRNAs, observed upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and in different genotypes and organs, were confirmed by RT-qPCR. Corresponding target transcripts, predicted in silico and validated by RT-qPCR, often showed opposite expression profiles than the related miRNAs. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> effects on miRNA abundance differed between the two genotypes. Furthermore, the concentration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-responsive miRNAs in each genotype was affected by reciprocal grafting, suggesting either the movement of signals inducing miRNA expression in the graft partner or, possibly, miRNA transport between scion and rootstock. These results open new perspectives in the selection of rootstocks for improving grapevine adaptation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>.</p>

Natural Variation in <i>OsLG3</i> Increases Drought Tolerance in Rice by Inducing ROS Scavenging
<p>Improving the performance of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress has the potential to significantly affect rice productivity. Here, we report that the ERF family transcription factor OsLG3 positively regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance in rice. In our previous work, we found that <i>OsLG3</i> has a positive effect on rice grain length without affecting grain quality. In this study, we found that <i>OsLG3</i> was more strongly expressed in upland rice than in lowland rice under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress conditions. By performing candidate gene association analysis, we found that natural variation in the promoter of <i>OsLG3</i> is associated with tolerance to osmotic stress in germinating rice seeds. Overexpression of <i>OsLG3</i> significantly improved the tolerance of rice plants to simulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, whereas suppression of <i>OsLG3</i> resulted in greater susceptibility. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the tolerant allele of <i>OsLG3</i> may improve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance in cultivated <i>japonica</i> rice. Introgression lines and complementation transgenic lines containing the elite allele of <i>OsLG3</i><sup>IRAT109</sup> showed increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance, demonstrating that natural variation in <i>OsLG3</i> contributes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance in rice. Further investigation suggested that <i>OsLG3</i> plays a positive role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress tolerance in rice by inducing reactive oxygen species scavenging. Collectively, our findings reveal that natural variation in <i>OsLG3</i> contributes to rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance and that the elite allele of <i>OsLG3</i> is a promising genetic resource for the development of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-tolerant rice varieties.</p>

The Arabidopsis DNA Methylome Is Stable under Transgenerational Drought Stress
<p>Improving the responsiveness, acclimation, and memory of plants to abiotic stress holds substantive potential for improving agriculture. An unresolved question is the involvement of chromatin marks in the memory of agriculturally relevant stresses. Such potential has spurred numerous investigations yielding both promising and conflicting results. Consequently, it remains unclear to what extent robust stress-induced DNA methylation variation can underpin stress memory. Using a slow-onset water deprivation treatment in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we investigated the malleability of the DNA methylome to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress within a generation and under repeated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress over five successive generations. While <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-associated epi-alleles in the methylome were detected within a generation, they did not correlate with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-responsive gene expression. Six traits were analyzed for transgenerational stress memory, and the descendants of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-stressed lineages showed one case of memory in the form of increased seed dormancy, and that persisted one generation removed from stress. With respect to transgenerational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress, there were negligible conserved differentially methylated regions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-exposed lineages compared with unstressed lineages. Instead, the majority of observed variation was tied to stochastic or preexisting differences in the epigenome occurring at repetitive regions of the Arabidopsis genome. Furthermore, the experience of repeated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress was not observed to influence transgenerational epi-allele accumulation. Our findings demonstrate that, while transgenerational memory is observed in one of six traits examined, they are not associated with causative changes in the DNA methylome, which appears relatively impervious to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress.</p>

Dead or Alive? Using Membrane Failure and Chlorophyll <i>a</i> Fluorescence to Predict Plant Mortality from Drought
<p>Climate models predict widespread increases in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> intensity and duration in the next decades. Although water deficiency is a significant determinant of plant survival, limited understanding of plant responses to extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> impedes forecasts of both forest and crop productivity under increasing aridity. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> induces a suite of physiological responses; however, we lack an accurate mechanistic description of plant response to lethal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> that would improve predictive understanding of mortality under altered climate conditions. Here, proxies for leaf cellular damage, chlorophyll <i>a</i> fluorescence, and electrolyte leakage were directly associated with failure to recover from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> upon rewatering in <i>Brassica</i> <i>rapa</i> (genotype R500) and thus define the exact timing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-induced death. We validated our results using a second genotype (imb211) that differs substantially in life history traits. Our study demonstrates that whereas changes in carbon dynamics and water transport are critical indicators of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress, they can be unrelated to visible metrics of mortality, i.e. lack of meristematic activity and regrowth. In contrast, membrane failure at the cellular scale is the most proximate cause of death. This hypothesis was corroborated in two gymnosperms (<i>Picea engelmannii</i> and <i>Pinus contorta</i>) that experienced lethal water stress in the field and in laboratory conditions. We suggest that measurement of chlorophyll <i>a</i> fluorescence can be used to operationally define plant death arising from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, and improved plant characterization can enhance surface model predictions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> mortality and its consequences to ecosystem services at a global scale.</p>

MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 Enhance Drought Tolerance by Modulating Root Vessels and Cell Walls in Apple
<p>Water deficit is one of the main limiting factors in apple (<i>Malus</i> × <i>domestica</i> Borkh.) cultivation. Root architecture plays an important role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance of plants; however, research efforts to improve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance of apple trees have focused on aboveground targets. Due to the difficulties associated with visualization and data analysis, there is currently a poor understanding of the genetic players and molecular mechanisms involved in the root architecture of apple trees under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> conditions. We previously observed that MdMYB88 and its paralog MdMYB124 regulate apple tree root morphology. In this study, we found that MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 play important roles in maintaining root hydraulic conductivity under long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> conditions and therefore contribute toward adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance. Further investigation revealed that MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 regulate root xylem development by directly binding <i>MdVND6</i> and <i>MdMYB46</i> promoters and thus influence expression of their target genes under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> conditions. In addition, MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 were shown to regulate the deposition of cellulose and lignin root cell walls in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>. Taken together, our results provide novel insights into the importance of MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 in root architecture, root xylem development, and secondary cell wall deposition in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> in apple trees.</p>

Mechanical Failure of Fine Root Cortical Cells Initiates Plant Hydraulic Decline during Drought
<p>Root systems perform the crucial task of absorbing water from the soil to meet the demands of a transpiring canopy. Roots are thought to operate like electrical fuses, which break when carrying an excessive load under conditions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress. Yet the exact site and sequence of this dysfunction in roots remain elusive. Using in vivo x-ray computed microtomography, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-induced mechanical failure (i.e. lacunae formation) in fine root cortical cells is the initial and primary driver of reduced fine root hydraulic conductivity (Lp<sub>r</sub>) under mild to moderate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress. Cortical lacunae started forming under mild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress (−0.6 MPa Ψ<sub>stem</sub>), coincided with a dramatic reduction in Lp<sub>r</sub>, and preceded root shrinkage or significant xylem embolism. Only under increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress was embolism formation observed in the root xylem, and it appeared first in the fine roots (50% loss of hydraulic conductivity [P<sub>50</sub>] reached at −1.8 MPa) and then in older, coarse roots (P<sub>50</sub> = −3.5 MPa). These results suggest that cortical cells in fine roots function like hydraulic fuses that decouple plants from drying soil, thus preserving the hydraulic integrity of the plant’s vascular system under early stages of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress. Cortical lacunae formation led to permanent structural damage of the root cortex and nonrecoverable Lp<sub>r</sub>, pointing to a role in fine root mortality and turnover under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress.</p>

Limited acclimation in leaf anatomy to experimental drought in tropical rainforest trees
<p>Dry periods are predicted to become more frequent and severe in the future in some parts of the tropics, including Amazonia, potentially causing reduced productivity, higher tree mortality and increased emissions of stored carbon. Using a long-term (12 year) through-fall exclusion (TFE) experiment in the tropics, we test the hypothesis that trees produce leaves adapted to cope with higher levels of water stress, by examining the following leaf characteristics: area, thickness, leaf mass per area, vein density, stomatal density, the thickness of palisade mesophyll, spongy mesophyll and both of the epidermal layers, internal cavity volume and the average cell sizes of the palisade and spongy mesophyll. We also test whether differences in leaf anatomy are consistent with observed differential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-induced mortality responses among taxa, and look for relationships between leaf anatomy, and leaf water relations and gas exchange parameters. Our data show that trees do not produce leaves that are more xeromorphic in response to 12 years of soil moisture deficit. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> treatment did result in increases in the thickness of the adaxial epidermis (TFE: 20.5 ± 1.5 µm, control: 16.7 ± 1.0 µm) and the internal cavity volume (TFE: 2.43 ± 0.50 mm<sup>3</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup>, control: 1.77 ± 0.30 mm<sup>3 </sup>cm<sup>−2</sup>). No consistent differences were detected between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-resistant and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-sensitive taxa, although interactions occurred between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-sensitivity status and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> treatment for the palisade mesophyll thickness (<i>P</i> = 0.034) and the cavity volume of the leaves (<i>P</i> = 0.025). The limited response to water deficit probably reflects a tight co-ordination between leaf morphology, water relations and photosynthetic properties. This suggests that there is little plasticity in these aspects of plant anatomy in these taxa, and that phenotypic plasticity in leaf traits may not facilitate the acclimation of Amazonian trees to the predicted future reductions in dry season water availability.</p>

Impact of summer drought on isoprenoid emissions and carbon sink of three Scots pine provenances
<p>Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L.) provenances cover broad ecological amplitudes. In a greenhouse study, we investigated the impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress and rewetting on gas exchange for three provenances (Italy: Emilia Romagna; Spain: Alto Ebro; Germany: East-German lowlands) of 2-year old Scots pine seedlings. CO<sub>2</sub>, water vapour and isoprenoid exchange of stressed and control trees were quantified with a four-chamber dynamic-enclosure system in the controlled environment of a climate chamber. The three provenances showed distinct isoprenoid emission patterns and were classified into a non-Δ<sup>3</sup>-carene, with either high α-/β-pinene or β-myrcene fraction, and a Δ<sup>3</sup>-carene dominated type. Isoprenoid emission rates, net-photosynthesis and transpiration were reduced during summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress and significantly recovered after rewetting. A seasonal increase of isoprenoid emission rates towards autumn was observed for all control groups. Compared with the German provenance, the Spanish and Italian provenances revealed higher isoprenoid emission rates and more plastic responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress and seasonal development, which points to a local adaptation to climate. As a result of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, net carbon uptake and transpiration of trees was reduced, but recovered after rewetting. We conclude from our study that Scots pine isoprenoid emission is more variable than expected and sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> periods, likely impacting regional air chemistry. Thus, a provenance-specific emission assessment accounting for reduced emission during prolonged (summer) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> is recommend for setting up biogenic volatile organic compound emission inventories used in air quality models.</p>

Differential radial growth patterns between beech (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L.) and oak (<i>Quercus robur</i> L.) on periodically waterlogged soils
<p>Climate scenarios for northern Central Europe project rising temperatures and increasing frequency and intensity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>s but also a shift in precipitation pattern with more humid winters. This in turn may result in soil waterlogging during the following spring, leading to increasing stress for trees growing on hydric sites. The influence of waterlogging on growth of common beech and pedunculate oak has been studied intensively on seedlings under experimental conditions. However, the question remains whether results of these studies can be transferred to mature trees growing under natural conditions. To test this, we investigated general growth patterns and climate–growth relationships in four mature stands of beech and oak growing on hydromorphic soils (Stagnosols) in northeast Germany using dendrochronological methods. Our results confirmed the expected tolerance of oak to strong water-level fluctuations. Neither extremely wet conditions during spring nor summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>s significantly affected its radial growth. Oak growth responded positively to warmer temperatures during previous year October and March of the current year of ring formation. Contrary to our expectations, also beech showed relatively low sensitivity to periods of high soil water saturation. Instead, summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> turned out to be the main climatic factor influencing ring width of beech even under the specific periodically wet soil conditions of our study. This became evident from general climate–growth correlations over the last century as well as from discontinuous (pointer year) analysis with summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> being significantly correlated to the occurrence of growth depressions. As ring width of the two species is affected by differing climate parameters, species-specific chronologies show no coherence in high-frequency variations even for trees growing in close proximity. We assume differences in rooting depth as the main reason for the differing growth patterns and climate correlations of the two species under study. Our results indicate that under the projected future climate scenarios, beech may suffer from increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress even on hydromorphic soils. Oak might be able to maintain a sufficient hydraulic status during summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>s by reaching water in deeper soil strata with its root system. Wet phases with waterlogged soil conditions during spring or summer appear to have only a little direct influence on radial growth of both species.</p>

BES/BZR Transcription Factor TaBZR2 Positively Regulates Drought Responses by Activation of <i>TaGST1</i>
<p>BRI1-EMS suppressor (BES)/brassinazole-resistant (BZR) family transcription factors are involved in a variety of physiological processes, but the biological functions of some BES/BZR transcription factors remain unknown; moreover, it is not clear if any of these proteins function in the regulation of plant stress responses. Here, wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) brassinazole-resistant 2 (<i>TaBZR2</i>)-overexpressing plants exhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerant phenotypes, whereas downregulation of <i>TaBZR2</i> in wheat by RNA interference resulted in elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> sensitivity. electrophoretic mobility shift assay and luciferase reporter analysis illustrate that TaBZR2 directly interacts with the gene promoter to activate the expression of <i>T. aestivum</i> glutathione s-transferase-1 (<i>TaGST1</i>), which functions positively in scavenging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-induced superoxide anions (O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>). Moreover, TaBZR2 acts as a positive regulator in brassinosteroid (BR) signaling. Exogenous BR treatment enhanced TaBZR2-mediated O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> scavenging and antioxidant enzyme gene expression. Taken together, we demonstrate that a BES/BZR family transcription factor, TaBZR2, functions positively in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> responses by activating <i>TaGST1</i> and mediates the crosstalk between BR and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> signaling pathways. Our results thus provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying how BES/BZR family transcription factors contribute to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance in wheat.</p>

VAMP711 Is Required for Abscisic Acid-Mediated Inhibition of Plasma Membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Activity
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress is a limiting environmental factor that affects plant growth and development. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> responses. Previous studies have indicated that ABA inhibits plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase) activity, and the decrease in PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity promotes stomatal closure under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress, thereby reducing water loss. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we found that in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), ABA induces an <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor protein, namely, VESICLE-ASSOCIATED MEMBRANE PROTEIN 711 (VAMP711), to interact with the Arabidopsis PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases AHA1 and AHA2. The interaction occurs at their C-termini and inhibits PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity. Deletion of <i>VAMP711</i> in Arabidopsis results in a higher PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity and slower stomatal closure in response to ABA and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> treatments. In addition, overexpression of <i>VAMP711</i> partially rescues the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-sensitive phenotype of <i>ost2-2D</i>, a mutation in <i>AHA1</i> resulting in a constitutive activated PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. Our results demonstrate that VAMP711 is involved in regulating ABA-mediated inhibition of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity and stomatal closure in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress.</p>

An Ancestral Allele of <i>Pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase1</i> Promotes Proline Accumulation and Drought Adaptation in Cultivated Barley
<p>Water scarcity is a critical threat to global crop production. Here, we used the natural diversity of barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) to dissect the genetic control of proline (Pro) mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress adaptation. Genetic mapping and positional cloning of a major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-inducible quantitative trait locus (<i>QPro.S42-1H</i>) revealed unique allelic variation in <i>pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase</i> (<i>P5cs1</i>) between the cultivated cultivar Scarlett (ssp. <i>vulgare</i>) and the wild barley accession ISR42-8 (ssp. <i>spontaneum</i>). The putative causative mutations were located in the promoter of <i>P5cs1</i> across the DNA binding motifs for abscisic acid-responsive element binding transcription factors. Introgression line (IL) S42IL-143 carrying the wild allele of <i>P5cs1</i> showed significant up-regulation of <i>P5cs1</i> expression compared to Scarlett, which was consistent with variation in Pro accumulation under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>. Next, we transiently expressed promoter::reporter constructs of ISR42-8 and Scarlett alleles in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mesophyll protoplasts. GUS expression analysis showed a significantly higher activation of the ISR42-8 promoter compared to Scarlett upon abscisic acid treatment. Notably, the ISR42-8 promoter activity was impaired in protoplasts isolated from the loss-of-function <i>abf1abf2abf3abf4</i> quadruple mutant. A series of phenotypic evaluations demonstrated that S42IL-143 maintained leaf water content and photosynthetic activity longer than Scarlett under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>. These findings suggest that the ancestral variant of <i>P5cs1</i> has the potential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance and understanding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> physiology of barley and related crops.</p>

SIAMESE-RELATED1 Is Regulated Posttranslationally and Participates in Repression of Leaf Growth under Moderate Drought
<p>The plant cell cycle is tightly regulated by factors that integrate endogenous cues and environmental signals to adapt plant growth to changing conditions. Under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, cell division in young leaves is blocked by an active mechanism, reducing the evaporative surface and conserving energy resources. The molecular function of cyclin-dependent kinase-inhibitory proteins (CKIs) in regulating the cell cycle has already been well studied, but little is known about their involvement in cell cycle regulation under adverse growth conditions. In this study, we show that the transcript of the CKI gene <i>SIAMESE-RELATED1</i> (<i>SMR1</i>) is quickly induced under moderate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> in young Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves. Functional characterization further revealed that SMR1 inhibits cell division and affects meristem activity, thereby restricting the growth of leaves and roots. Moreover, we demonstrate that SMR1 is a short-lived protein that is degraded by the 26S proteasome after being ubiquitinated by a Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase. Consequently, overexpression of a more stable variant of the SMR1 protein leads to a much stronger phenotype than overexpression of the native SMR1. Under moderate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, both the <i>SMR1</i> transcript and SMR1 protein accumulate. Despite this induction, <i>smr1</i> mutants do not show overall tolerance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress but do show less growth inhibition of young leaves under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>.

The E3 Ligase TaSAP5 Alters Drought Stress Responses by Promoting the Degradation of DRIP Proteins
<p>In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants growing under normal conditions, DEHYDRATION-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN2A (DREB2A) is present at low levels because it is ubiquitinated and destabilized by DREB2A INTERACTING PROTEIN1 (DRIP1) and DRIP2 through 26S proteasome-mediated proteolysis. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress counteracts the ubiquitination and proteolysis of DREB2A, thus allowing the accumulation of sufficient amounts of DREB2A protein to activate downstream gene expression. The mechanisms leading to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress-mediated DREB2A accumulation are still unclear. Here, we report that the wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) TaSAP5 protein, which contains an A20/AN1 domain, acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to mediate DRIP degradation and thus increase DREB2A protein levels. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> induces <i>TaSAP5</i> expression in wheat, and <i>TaSAP5</i> overexpression in Arabidopsis and wheat seedlings increased their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance, as measured by survival rate and grain yield under severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress. TaSAP5 can interact with and ubiquitinate TaDRIP, as well as AtDRIP1 and AtDRIP2, leading to their subsequent degradation through the 26S proteasome pathway. Consistent with this, <i>TaSAP5</i> overexpression enhances DRIP degradation and increases the levels of DREB2A protein and its downstream targets. These results suggest that TaSAP5 acts to link <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> with DREB2A accumulation and illustrate the molecular mechanisms involved in this process.</p>

Two Chloroplast Proteins Suppress Drought Resistance by Affecting ROS Production in Guard Cells
<p>Chloroplast as the site for photosynthesis is an essential organelle in plants, but little is known about its role in stomatal regulation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> resistance. In this study, we show that two chloroplastic proteins essential for thylakoid formation negatively regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> resistance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). By screening a mutant pool with T-DNA insertions in nuclear genes encoding chloroplastic proteins, we identified an <i>HCF106</i> knockdown mutant exhibiting increased resistance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress. The <i>hcf106</i> mutant displayed elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in guard cells, improved stomatal closure, and reduced water loss under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> conditions. The HCF106 protein was found to physically interact with THF1, a previously identified chloroplastic protein crucial for thylakoid formation. The <i>thf1</i> mutant phenotypically resembled the <i>hcf106</i> mutant and displayed more ROS accumulation in guard cells, increased stomatal closure, reduced water loss, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> resistant phenotypes compared to the wild type. The <i>hcf106thf1</i> double mutant behaved similarly as the <i>thf1</i> single mutant. These results suggest that HCF106 and THF1 form a complex to modulate chloroplast function and that the complex is important for ROS production in guard cells and stomatal control in response to environmental stresses. Our results also suggest that modulating chloroplastic proteins could be a way for improving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> resistance in crops.</p>

A NAC Transcription Factor Represses Putrescine Biosynthesis and Affects Drought Tolerance
<p>Arginine decarboxylase (ADC)-mediated putrescine biosynthesis plays an important role in plant stress responses, but the transcriptional regulation of <i>ADC</i> in response to abiotic stress is not well understood. We isolated a NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC (NAC) domain-containing transcription factor, PtrNAC72, from trifoliate orange (<i>Poncirus trifoliata</i>) by yeast one-hybrid screening. PtrNAC72, localized to the nucleus, binds specifically to the promoter of <i>PtADC</i> and acts as a transcriptional repressor. <i>PtrNAC72</i> expression was induced by cold, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, and abscisic acid. <i>ADC</i> messenger RNA abundance and putrescine levels were decreased in transgenic tobacco (<i>Nicotiana nudicaulis</i>) plants overexpressing <i>PtrNAC72</i> but increased, compared with the wild type, in an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) transfer DNA insertion mutant, <i>nac72</i>. While transgenic tobacco lines overexpressing <i>PtrNAC72</i> were more sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, plants of the Arabidopsis <i>nac72</i> mutant exhibited enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance, consistent with the accumulation of reactive oxygen species in the tested genotypes. In addition, exogenous application of putrescine to the overexpression lines restored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance, while treatment with <sc>d</sc>-arginine, an ADC inhibitor, compromised the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance of <i>nac72</i>. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PtrNAC72 is a repressor of putrescine biosynthesis and may negatively regulate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress response, at least in part, via the modulation of putrescine-associated reactive oxygen species homeostasis.</p>

Spatiotemporal Coupling of Vessel Cavitation and Discharge of Stored Xylem Water in a Tree Sapling
<p>Water discharge from stem internal storage compartments is thought to minimize the risk of vessel cavitation. Based on this concept, one would expect that water storage compartments involved in the buffering of xylem tensions empty before the onset of vessel cavitation under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress, and potentially refill after soil saturation. However, scant in vivo data exist that elucidate this localized spatiotemporal coupling. In this study on intact saplings of American chestnut (<i>Castanea dentata</i>), x-ray computed microtomography (microCT) showed that the xylem matrix surrounding vessels releases stored water and becomes air-filled either concurrent to or after vessel cavitation under progressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress. Among annual growth rings, the xylem matrix of the current year remained largely water-filled even under severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress. In comparison, microtomography images collected on excised stems showed that applied pressures of much greater than 0 MPa were required to induce water release from the xylem matrix. Viability staining highlighted that water release from the xylem matrix was associated primarily with emptying of dead fibers. Refilling of the xylem matrix and vessels was detected in intact saplings when the canopy was bagged and stem water potential was close to 0 MPa, and in leafless saplings over the winter period. In conclusion, this study indicates that the bulk of water stored in the xylem matrix is released after the onset of vessel cavitation, and suggests that capillary water contributes to overall stem water storage under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> but is not used primarily for the prevention of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-induced vessel cavitation in this species.</p>

Overexpression of RING Domain E3 Ligase ZmXerico1 Confers Drought Tolerance through Regulation of ABA Homeostasis
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress is one of the main environmental problems encountered by crop growers. Reduction in arable land area and reduced water availability make it paramount to identify and develop strategies to allow crops to be more resilient in water-limiting environments. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in the plants’ response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress through its control of stomatal aperture and water transpiration, and transgenic modulation of ABA levels therefore represents an attractive avenue to improve the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance of crops. Several steps in the ABA-signaling pathway are controlled by ubiquitination involving really interesting new genes (RING) domain-containing proteins. We characterized the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) RING protein family and identified two novel RING-H2 genes called <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i>. Expression of <i>ZmXerico</i> genes is induced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress, and we show that overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in Arabidopsis and maize confers ABA hypersensitivity and improved water use efficiency, which can lead to enhanced maize yield performance in a controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-stress environment. Overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in maize results in increased ABA levels and decreased levels of ABA degradation products diphaseic acid and phaseic acid. We show that ZmXerico1 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where ABA 8′-hydroxylases have been shown to be localized, and that it functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We demonstrate that ZmXerico1 plays a role in the control of ABA homeostasis through regulation of ABA 8′-hydroxylase protein stability, representing a novel control point in the regulation of the ABA pathway.</p>

A Nucleus-Localized Long Non-Coding RNA Enhances Drought and Salt Stress Tolerance
<p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) affect gene expression through a wide range of mechanisms and are considered as important regulators in many essential biological processes. A large number of lncRNA transcripts have been predicted or identified in plants in recent years. However, the biological functions for most of them are still unknown. In this study, we identified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lncRNA, <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> INDUCED lncRNA</i> (<i>DRIR</i>), as a novel positive regulator of the plant response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and salt stress. <i>DRIR</i> was expressed at a low level under nonstress conditions but can be significantly activated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and salt stress as well as by abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. We identified a T-DNA insertion mutant, <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i>, which had higher expression of the <i>DRIR</i> gene than the wild-type plants. The <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> mutant exhibits increased tolerance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and salt stress. Overexpressing <i>DRIR</i> in Arabidopsis also increased tolerance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and salt stress of the transgenic plants. The <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> mutant and the overexpressing seedlings are more sensitive to ABA than the wild type in stomata closure and seedling growth. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the expression of a large number of genes was altered in <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> and the overexpressing plants. These include genes involved in ABA signaling, water transport, and other stress-relief processes. Our study reveals a mechanism whereby <i>DRIR</i> regulates the plant response to abiotic stress by modulating the expression of a series of genes involved in the stress response.</p>

SENSITIVE TO FREEZING2 Aides in Resilience to Salt and Drought in Freezing-Sensitive Tomato
<p>SENSITIVE TO FREEZING2 (SFR2) is crucial for protecting chloroplast membranes following freezing in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). It has been shown that SFR2 homologs are present in all land plants, including freezing-sensitive species, raising the question of SFR2 function beyond freezing tolerance. Similar to freezing, salt and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> can cause dehydration. Thus, it is hypothesized that in freezing-sensitive plants SFR2 may play roles in their resilience to salt or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>. To test this hypothesis, <i>SlSFR2</i> RNAi lines were generated in the cold/freezing-sensitive species tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> [M82 <i>cv</i>]). Hypersensitivity to salt and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> of <i>SlSFR2</i>-RNAi lines was observed. Higher tolerance of wild-type tomatoes was correlated with the production of trigalactosyldiacylglycerol, a product of SFR2 activity. Tomato SFR2 in vitro activity is Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and its optimal pH is 7.5, similar to that of Arabidopsis SFR2, but the specific activity of tomato SFR2 in vitro is almost double that of Arabidopsis SFR2. When salt and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress were applied to Arabidopsis, no conditions could be identified at which SFR2 was induced prior to irreversibly impacting plant growth, suggesting that SFR2 protects Arabidopsis primarily against freezing. Discovery of tomato SFR2 function in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and salt resilience provides further insights into general membrane lipid remodeling-based stress tolerance mechanisms and together with protection against freezing in freezing-resistant plants such as Arabidopsis, it adds lipid remodeling as a possible target for the engineering of abiotic stress-resilient crops.</p>

Termites mitigate the effects of drought in tropical rainforest
<p>Termites perform key ecological functions in tropical ecosystems, are strongly affected by variation in rainfall, and respond negatively to habitat disturbance. However, it is not known how the projected increase in frequency and severity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>s in tropical rainforests will alter termite communities and the maintenance of ecosystem processes. Using a large-scale termite suppression experiment, we found that termite activity and abundance increased during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> in a Bornean forest. This increase resulted in accelerated litter decomposition, elevated soil moisture, greater soil nutrient heterogeneity, and higher seedling survival rates during the extreme El Niño <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> of 2015–2016. Our work shows how an invertebrate group enhances ecosystem resistance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, providing evidence that the dual stressors of climate change and anthropogenic shifts in biotic communities will have various negative consequences for the maintenance of rainforest ecosystems.</p>

Low Vulnerability to Xylem Embolism in Leaves and Stems of North American Oaks
<p>Although recent findings suggest that xylem embolism represents a significant, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-induced damaging process in land plants, substantial debate surrounds the capacity of long-vesseled, ring-porous species to resist embolism. We investigated whether recent methodological developments could help resolve this controversy within <i>Quercus</i>, a long-vesseled, ring-porous temperate angiosperm genus, and shed further light on the importance of xylem vulnerability to embolism as an indicator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance. We used the optical technique to quantify leaf and stem xylem vulnerability to embolism of eight <i>Quercus</i> species from the Mediterranean-type climate region of California to examine absolute measures of resistance to embolism as well as any potential hydraulic segmentation between tissue types. We demonstrated that our optical assessment reflected flow impairment for a subset of our sample species by quantifying changes in leaf hydraulic conductance in dehydrating branches. Air-entry water potential varied 2-fold in leaves, ranging from −1.7 ± 0.25 MPa to −3.74 ± 0.23 MPa, and 4-fold in stems, ranging from −1.17 ± 0.04 MPa to −4.91 ± 0.3 MPa. Embolism occurred earlier in leaves than in stems in only one out of eight sample species, and plants always lost turgor before experiencing stem embolism. Our results show that long-vesseled North American <i>Quercus</i> species are more resistant to embolism than previously thought and support the hypothesis that avoiding stem embolism is a critical component of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance in woody trees. Accurately quantifying xylem vulnerability to embolism is essential for understanding species distributions along aridity gradients and predicting plant mortality during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>.</p>

Knockdown of Rice MicroRNA166 Confers Drought Resistance by Causing Leaf Rolling and Altering Stem Xylem Development
<p>MicroRNAs are 19- to 22-nucleotide small noncoding RNAs that have been implicated in abiotic stress responses. In this study, we found that knockdown of microRNA166, using the Short Tandem Target Mimic (STTM) system, resulted in morphological changes that confer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> resistance in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). From a large-scale screen for miRNA knockdown lines in rice, we identified miR166 knockdown lines (STTM166); these plants exhibit a rolled-leaf phenotype, which is normally displayed by rice plants under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress. The leaves of STTM166 rice plants had smaller bulliform cells and abnormal sclerenchymatous cells, likely causing the rolled-leaf phenotype. The STTM166 plants had reduced stomatal conductance and showed decreased transpiration rates. The STTM166 lines also exhibited altered stem xylem and decreased hydraulic conductivity, likely due to the reduced diameter of the xylem vessels. Molecular analyses identified rice <i>HOMEODOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN4</i> (<i>OsHB4</i>), a member of HD-Zip III gene family, as a major target of miR166; moreover, rice plants overexpressing a miR166-resistant form of <i>OsHB4</i> resembled the STTM166 plants, including leaf rolling and higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> resistance. The genes downstream of miR166-<i>OsHB4</i> consisted of polysaccharide synthesis-related genes that may contribute to cell wall formation and vascular development. Our results suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> resistance in rice can be increased by manipulating miRNAs, which leads to developmental changes, such as leaf rolling and reduced diameter of the xylem, that mimic plants’ natural responses to water-deficit stress.</p>

Winter drought impairs xylem phenology, anatomy and growth in Mediterranean Scots pine forests
<p>Continental Mediterranean forests face <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> but also cold spells and both climate extremes can impair the resilience capacity of these forests. Climate warming could amplify the negative effects of cold spells by inducing premature dehardening. Here we capitalize on a winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-induced dieback triggered by a cold spell which occurred in December 2001 affecting Scots pine forests in eastern Spain. We assessed post-dieback recovery by quantifying and comparing radial growth and xylem anatomy of non-declining (ND, crown cover >50%) and declining (D, crown cover ≤50%) trees in two sites (VP, Villarroya de los Pinares; TO, Torrijas). We also characterized xylogenesis in both sites and aboveground productivity in site VP. Dieback caused legacy effects since needle loss, a 60% reduction in litter fall and radial-growth decline characterized D-trees 3 years after dieback symptoms started appearing in spring 2002. D-trees formed collapsed tracheids in the 2002-ring, particularly in the most affected VP site where xylogenesis differences between ND and D trees were most noticeable. The lower growth rates of D-trees were caused by a shorter duration of their major xylogenesis phases. In site VP the radial-enlargement and wall-thickening of tracheids were significantly reduced in D-trees as compared to ND-trees because these xylogenesis phases tended to start earlier and end later in ND-trees. Gompertz models fitted to tracheid production predicted that maximum growth rates occurred 11–12 days earlier in ND than in D-trees. The formation of radially-enlarging tracheids was enhanced by longer days in both study sites and also by wetter conditions in the driest TO site, but xylogenesis sensitivity to climate was reduced in D-trees. Winter-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> dieback impairs xylem anatomy and phenology, aboveground productivity, xylogenesis and growth in Mediterranean Scots pine populations. Affected stands show a costly post-dieback recovery challenging their resilience ability.</p>

Root Engineering in Barley: Increasing Cytokinin Degradation Produces a Larger Root System, Mineral Enrichment in the Shoot and Improved Drought Tolerance
<p>Root size and architecture are important crop plant traits, as they determine access to water and soil nutrients. The plant hormone cytokinin is a negative regulator of root growth and branching. Here, we generated transgenic barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) plants with an enlarged root system by enhancing cytokinin degradation in roots to explore the potential of cytokinin modulations in improving root functions. This was achieved through root-specific expression of a <i>CYTOKININ OXIDASE/DEHYDROGENASE</i> gene. Enhanced biomass allocation to roots did not penalize shoot growth or seed yield, indicating that these plants were not source limited. In leaves of transgenic lines, the concentrations of several macroelements and microelements were increased, particularly those with low soil mobility (phosphorus, manganese, and zinc). Importantly, seeds contained up to 44% more zinc, which is beneficial for human nutrition. Transgenic lines also demonstrated dampened stress responses to long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> conditions, indicating lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> sensitivity. Taken together, this work demonstrates that root engineering of cereals is a promising strategy to improve nutrient efficiency, biofortification, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance.</p>

Potato Mop-Top Virus Co-Opts the Stress Sensor HIPP26 for Long-Distance Movement
<p>Virus movement proteins facilitate virus entry into the vascular system to initiate systemic infection. The potato mop-top virus (PMTV) movement protein, TGB1, is involved in long-distance movement of both viral ribonucleoprotein complexes and virions. Here, our analysis of TGB1 interactions with host <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> proteins revealed an interaction with a member of the heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant protein family, HIPP26, which acts as a plasma membrane-to-nucleus signal during abiotic stress. We found that knockdown of <i>NbHIPP26</i> expression inhibited virus long-distance movement but did not affect cell-to-cell movement. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and PMTV infection up-regulated <i>NbHIPP26</i> gene expression, and PMTV infection protected plants from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>. In addition, <i>NbHIPP26</i> promoter-reporter fusions revealed vascular tissue-specific expression. Mutational and biochemical analyses indicated that NbHIPP26 subcellular localization at the plasma membrane and plasmodesmata was mediated by lipidation (<i>S</i>-acylation and prenylation), as nonlipidated NbHIPP26 was predominantly in the nucleus. Notably, coexpression of NbHIPP26 with TGB1 resulted in a similar nuclear accumulation of NbHIPP26. TGB1 interacted with the carboxyl-terminal CVVM (prenyl) domain of NbHIPP26, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation revealed that the TGB1-HIPP26 complex localized to microtubules and accumulated in the nucleolus, with little signal at the plasma membrane or plasmodesmata. These data support a mechanism where interaction with TGB1 negates or reverses NbHIPP26 lipidation, thus releasing membrane-associated NbHIPP26 and redirecting it via microtubules to the nucleus, thereby activating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress response and facilitating virus long-distance movement.</p>

Quantifying Wheat Sensitivities to Environmental Constraints to Dissect Genotype × Environment Interactions in the Field
<p>Yield is subject to strong genotype-by-environment (G × E) interactions in the field, especially under abiotic constraints such as soil water deficit (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> [D]) and high temperature (heat [H]). Since environmental conditions show strong fluctuations during the whole crop cycle, geneticists usually do not consider environmental measures as quantitative variables but rather as factors in multienvironment analyses. Based on 11 experiments in a field platform with contrasting temperature and soil water deficit, we determined the periods of sensitivity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and heat constraints in wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) and determined the average sensitivities for major yield components. G × E interactions were separated into their underlying components, constitutive genotypic effect (G), G × D, G × H, and G × H × D, and were analyzed for two genotypes, highlighting contrasting responses to heat and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> constraints. We then tested the constitutive and responsive behaviors of two strong quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated previously with yield components. This analysis confirmed the constitutive effect of the chromosome 1B QTL and explained the G × E interaction of the chromosome 3B QTL by a benefit of one allele when temperature rises. In addition to the method itself, which can be applied to other data sets and populations, this study will support the cloning of a major yield QTL on chromosome 3B that is highly dependent on environmental conditions and for which the climatic interaction is now quantified.</p>

Drought-Enhanced Xylem Sap Sulfate Closes Stomata by Affecting ALMT12 and Guard Cell ABA Synthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Water limitation of plants causes stomatal closure to prevent water loss by transpiration. For this purpose, progressing soil water deficit is communicated from roots to shoots. Abscisic acid (ABA) is the key signal in stress-induced stomatal closure, but ABA as an early xylem-delivered signal is still a matter of debate. In this study, poplar plants (<i>Populus × canescens</i>) were exposed to water stress to investigate xylem sap sulfate and ABA, stomatal conductance, and sulfate transporter (<i>SULTR</i>) expression. In addition, stomatal behavior and expression of ABA receptors, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-responsive genes, transcription factors, and <i>NCED3</i> were studied after feeding sulfate and ABA to detached poplar leaves and epidermal peels of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The results show that increased xylem sap sulfate is achieved upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> by reduced xylem unloading by PtaSULTR3;3a and PtaSULTR1;1, and by enhanced loading from parenchyma cells into the xylem via PtaALMT3b. Sulfate application caused stomatal closure in excised leaves and peeled epidermis. In the loss of sulfate-channel function mutant, At<i>almt12</i>, sulfate-triggered stomatal closure was impaired. The QUAC1/ALMT12 anion channel heterologous expressed in oocytes was gated open by extracellular sulfate. Sulfate up-regulated the expression of <i>NCED3</i>, a key step of ABA synthesis, in guard cells. In conclusion, xylem-derived sulfate seems to be a chemical signal of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> that induces stomatal closure via QUAC1/ALMT12 and/or guard cell ABA synthesis.</p>

The Pepper RING-Type E3 Ligase CaAIRF1 Regulates ABA and Drought Signaling via CaADIP1 Protein Phosphatase Degradation
<p>Ubiquitin-mediated protein modification occurs at multiple steps of abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. Here, we sought proteins responsible for degradation of the pepper (<i>Capsicum annuum</i>) type 2C protein phosphatase CaADIP1 via the 26S proteasome system. We showed that the RING-type E3 ligase CaAIRF1 (<i>Capsicum annuum</i> ADIP1 Interacting RING Finger Protein 1) interacts with and ubiquitinates CaADIP1. CaADIP1 degradation was slower in crude proteins from <i>CaAIRF1</i>-silenced peppers than in those from control plants. <i>CaAIRF1</i>-silenced pepper plants displayed reduced ABA sensitivity and decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance characterized by delayed stomatal closure and suppressed induction of ABA- and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-responsive marker genes. In contrast, <i>CaAIRF1</i>-overexpressing Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants exhibited ABA-hypersensitive and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-tolerant phenotypes. Moreover, in these plants, CaADIP1-induced ABA hyposensitivity was strongly suppressed by <i>CaAIRF1</i> overexpression. Our findings highlight a potential new route for fine-tune regulation of ABA signaling in pepper via CaAIRF1 and CaADIP1.</p>

Outside-Xylem Vulnerability, Not Xylem Embolism, Controls Leaf Hydraulic Decline during Dehydration<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[CC-BY]</sup></xref>
<p>Leaf hydraulic supply is crucial to maintaining open stomata for CO<sub>2</sub> capture and plant growth. During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-induced dehydration, the leaf hydraulic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub>) declines, which contributes to stomatal closure and, eventually, to leaf death. Previous studies have tended to attribute the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> to embolism in the leaf vein xylem. We visualized at high resolution and quantified experimentally the hydraulic vulnerability of xylem and outside-xylem pathways and modeled their respective influences on plant water transport. Evidence from all approaches indicated that the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> during dehydration arose first and foremost due to the vulnerability of outside-xylem tissues. In vivo x-ray microcomputed tomography of dehydrating leaves of four diverse angiosperm species showed that, at the turgor loss point, only small fractions of leaf vein xylem conduits were embolized, and substantial xylem embolism arose only under severe dehydration. Experiments on an expanded set of eight angiosperm species showed that outside-xylem hydraulic vulnerability explained 75% to 100% of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline across the range of dehydration from mild water stress to beyond turgor loss point. Spatially explicit modeling of leaf water transport pointed to a role for reduced membrane conductivity consistent with published data for cells and tissues. Plant-scale modeling suggested that outside-xylem hydraulic vulnerability can protect the xylem from tensions that would induce embolism and disruption of water transport under mild to moderate soil and atmospheric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>s. These findings pinpoint outside-xylem tissues as a central locus for the control of leaf and plant water transport during progressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>.</p>

Tree Physiology
Combined effects of defoliation and water stress on pine growth and non-structural carbohydrates
<p>Climate change is expected to increase both pest insect damage and the occurrence of severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>. There is therefore a need to better understand the combined effects of biotic and abiotic damage on tree growth in order to predict the multi-factorial effect of climate change on forest ecosystem productivity. Indeed, the effect of stress interactions on tree growth is an increasingly important topic that greatly lacks experiments and data, and it is unlikely that the impact of combined stresses can be extrapolated from the outcomes of studies that focused on a single stress. We developed an original manipulative study under real field conditions where we applied artificial defoliation and induced water stress on 10-year-old (∼10 m high) maritime pine trees (<i>Pinus pinaster</i> Ait.). Tree response to combined stresses was quantitatively assessed following tree secondary growth and carbohydrate pools. Such a design allowed us to address the crucial question of combined stresses on trees under stand conditions, sharing soil supplies with neighboring trees. Our initial hypotheses were that (i) moderate defoliation can limit the impact of water stress on tree growth through reduced transpiration demand by a tree canopy partly defoliated and that (ii) defoliation results in reduced non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools, affecting tree tolerance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>. Our results showed additive effects of defoliation and water stress on tree growth and contradict our initial hypothesis. Indeed, under stand conditions, we found that partial defoliation does not limit the impact of water stress through reduced transpiration. Our study also highlighted that, even if NSC in all organs were affected by defoliation, tree response to water stress was not triggered. We found that stem NSC were maintained or increased during the entire growing season, supporting literature-based hypotheses such as an active maintenance of the hydraulic system or another limiting resource for tree growth under defoliation. We also observed a significant decrease in root carbohydrates, which suggests a shift in the root carbon balance under defoliation. The decrease in carbohydrate supply under defoliation may not counterbalance the carbon use for mineral and water uptakes or a translocation to other tissues.</p>

Above- and belowground controls on water use by trees of different wood types in an eastern US deciduous forest
<p>Stomata control tree transpiration by sensing and integrating environmental signals originating in the atmosphere and soil, and co-occurring species may differ in inherent stomatal sensitivity to these above- and belowground signals and in the types of signals to which they respond. Stomatal responsiveness to environmental signals is likely to differ across species having different types of wood (e.g., ring-porous, diffuse-porous and coniferous) because each wood type differs in the structure, size and spatial distribution of its xylem conduits as well as in the scaling of hydraulic properties with stem diameter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of variation in soil water availability and atmospheric evaporative demand on stomatal regulation of transpiration in seven co-occurring temperate deciduous forest species representing three wood types. We measured whole-tree sap flux and soil and atmospheric variables in a mixed deciduous forest in central Pennsylvania over the course of a growing season characterized by severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and large fluctuations in atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (<i>D</i>). The relative sensitivity of sap flux to soil drying was ∼2.2–2.3 times greater in the diffuse-porous and coniferous species than in the ring-porous species. Stomata of the ring-porous oaks were only about half as responsive to increased <i>D</i> as those of trees of the other two wood types. These differences in responsiveness to changes in the below- and aboveground environment implied that regulation of leaf water potential in the ring-porous oaks was less stringent than that in the diffuse-porous angiosperms or the conifers. The results suggest that increases in the frequency or intensity of summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>s in the study region could have multiple consequences for forest function, including altered successional time courses or climax species composition and cumulative effects on whole-tree architecture, resulting in a structural and physiological legacy that would restrict the ability of trees to respond rapidly to more favorable growth conditions.</p>

Printed subthreshold organic transistors operating at high gain and ultralow power
<p>Overcoming the trade-offs among power <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consumpt</span></strong>ion, fabrication cost, and signal amplification has been a long-standing issue for wearable electronics. We report a high-gain, fully inkjet-printed Schottky barrier organic thin-film transistor amplifier circuit. The transistor signal amplification efficiency is 38.2 siemens per ampere, which is near the theoretical thermionic limit, with an ultralow power <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consumpt</span></strong>ion of <1 nanowatt. The use of a Schottky barrier for the source gave the transistor geometry-independent electrical characteristics and accommodated the large dimensional variation in inkjet-printed features. These transistors exhibited good reliability with negligible threshold-voltage shift. We demonstrated this capability with an ultralow-power high-gain amplifier for the detection of electrophysiological signals and showed a signal-to-noise ratio of >60 decibels and noise voltage of <0.3 microvolt per hertz<sup>1/2</sup> at 100 hertz.</p>

Quantification of drought during the collapse of the classic Maya civilization
<p>The demise of Lowland Classic Maya civilization during the Terminal Classic Period (~800 to 1000 CE) is a well-cited example of how past climate may have affected ancient societies. Attempts to estimate the magnitude of hydrologic change, however, have met with equivocal success because of the qualitative and indirect nature of available climate proxy data. We reconstructed the past isotopic composition (δ<sup>18</sup>O, δD, <sup>17</sup>O-excess, and d-excess) of water in Lake Chichancanab, Mexico, using a technique that involves isotopic analysis of the structurally bound water in sedimentary gypsum, which was deposited under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> conditions. The triple oxygen and hydrogen isotope data provide a direct measure of past changes in lake hydrology. We modeled the data and conclude that annual precipitation decreased between 41 and 54% (with intervals of up to 70% rainfall reduction during peak <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> conditions) and that relative humidity declined by 2 to 7% compared to present-day conditions.</p>

Branch-specific plasticity of a bifunctional dopamine circuit encodes protein hunger
<p>Free-living animals must not only regulate the amount of food they consume but also choose which types of food to ingest. The shifting of food preference driven by nutrient-specific hunger can be essential for survival, yet little is known about the underlying mechanisms. We identified a dopamine circuit that encodes protein-specific hunger in <i>Drosophila</i>. The activity of these neurons increased after substantial protein deprivation. Activation of this circuit simultaneously promoted protein intake and restricted sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consumpt</span></strong>ion, via signaling to distinct downstream neurons. Protein starvation triggered branch-specific plastic changes in these dopaminergic neurons, thus enabling sustained protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consumpt</span></strong>ion. These studies reveal a crucial circuit mechanism by which animals adjust their dietary strategy to maintain protein homeostasis.</p>

The long-run poverty and gender impacts of mobile money

The impacts, which are more pronounced for female-headed households, appear to be driven by changes in financial behavior—in particular, increased financial resilience and saving—and labor market outcomes, such as occupational choice, especially for women, who moved out of agriculture and into business.

Mesophyll Abscisic Acid Restrains Early Growth and Flowering But Does Not Directly Suppress Photosynthesis
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) levels increase significantly in plants under stress conditions, and ABA is thought to serve as a key stress-response regulator. However, the direct effect of ABA on photosynthesis and the effect of mesophyll ABA on yield under both well-watered and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> conditions are still the subject of debate. Here, we examined this issue using transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants carrying a dominant ABA-signaling inhibitor under the control of a mesophyll-specific promoter (<i>FBPase::abi1-1</i>, abbreviated to <i>fa</i>). Under normal conditions, <i>fa</i> plants displayed slightly higher stomatal conductance and carbon assimilation than wild-type plants; however, these parameters were comparable following ABA treatment. These observations suggest that ABA does not directly inhibit photosynthesis in the short term. The <i>fa</i> plants also exhibited a variety of altered phenotypes under optimal conditions, including more vigorous initial growth, earlier flowering, smaller flowers, and delayed chlorophyll degradation. Furthermore, under optimal conditions, <i>fa</i> plant seed production was less than a third of that observed for the wild type. However, under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> conditions, wild-type and <i>fa</i> seed yields were similar due to a significant reduction in wild-type seed and no reduction in <i>fa</i> seed. These findings suggest that endogenous basal ABA inhibits a stress-escape response under nonstressed conditions, allowing plants to accumulate biomass and maximize yield. The lack of a correlation between flowering time and plant biomass combined with delayed chlorophyll degradation suggests that this stress-escape behavior is regulated independently and upstream of other ABA-induced effects such as rapid growth and flowering.</p>

Hydraulics Regulate Stomatal Responses to Changes in Leaf Water Status in the Fern <i>Athyrium filix</i>-<i>femina</i>
<p>Stomatal responses to changes in leaf water status are important for the diurnal regulation of gas exchange and the survival of plants during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>. These stomatal responses in angiosperm species are well characterized, yet in species of nonseed plants, an ongoing debate surrounds the role of metabolism, particularly the role of the hormone abscisic acid (ABA), in functionally regulating stomatal responses to changes in leaf water status. Here, we measured the stomatal response to changes in vapor pressure difference (VPD) in two natural forms of the fern species <i>Athyrium filix</i>-<i>femina</i>, recently suggested to have stomata that are regulated by ABA. The two forms measured had considerable differences in key hydraulic traits, including leaf hydraulic conductance and capacitance, as well as the kinetics of stomatal response to changes in VPD. In both forms, the stomatal responses to VPD could be accurately predicted by a dynamic, mechanistic model that assumes guard cell turgor changes in concert with leaf turgor in the light, and not via metabolic processes including the level of ABA. During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, endogenous ABA did not play a role in stomatal closure, and exogenous ABA applied to live, intact leaves did not induce stomatal closure. Our results indicate that functional stomatal responses to changes in leaf water status in ferns are regulated by leaf hydraulics and not metabolism. With ferns being sister to seed plants, this result has implications for the evolutionary reconstruction of functional stomatal responses across vascular land plant lineages.</p>

The Causes of Leaf Hydraulic Vulnerability and Its Influence on Gas Exchange in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The influence of the dynamics of leaf hydraulic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub>) diurnally and during dehydration on stomatal conductance and photosynthesis remains unclear. Using the model species Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> ecotype Columbia-0), we applied a multitiered approach including physiological measurements, high-resolution x-ray microcomputed tomography, and modeling at a range of scales to characterize (1) <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline during dehydration; (2) its basis in the hydraulic conductances of leaf xylem and outside-xylem pathways (<i>K</i><sub>ox</sub>); (3) the dependence of its dynamics on irradiance; (4) its impact on diurnal patterns of stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate; and (5) its influence on gas exchange and survival under simulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> regimes. Arabidopsis leaves showed strong vulnerability to dehydration diurnally in both gas exchange and hydraulic conductance, despite lack of xylem embolism or conduit collapse above the turgor loss point, indicating a pronounced sensitivity of <i>K</i><sub>ox</sub> to dehydration. <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> increased under higher irradiance in well-hydrated leaves across the full range of water potential, but no shift in <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> vulnerability was observed. Modeling indicated that responses to dehydration and irradiance are likely attributable to changes in membrane permeability and that a dynamic <i>K</i><sub>ox</sub> would contribute strongly to stomatal closure, improving performance, survival, and efficient water use during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>. These findings for Columbia-0 provide a baseline for assessing variation across genotypes in hydraulic traits and their influence on gas exchange during dehydration.</p>

Trehalose 6-Phosphate Regulates Photosynthesis and Assimilate Partitioning in Reproductive Tissue<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Transgenic maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) that expresses rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>TREHALOSE PHOSPHATE PHOSPHATASE1</i> (<i>TPP1</i>) from the rice <i>MADS6</i> promoter, which is active over the flowering period, produces higher yields than wild type. This yield increase occurs with or without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> conditions during flowering. To understand the mechanistic basis of the increased yield, we characterized gene expression and metabolite profiles in leaves and developing female reproductive tissue, comprising florets, node, pith, and shank, over the flowering period with and without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>. The <i>MADS6</i> promoter was most active in the vasculature, particularly phloem companion cells in florets and pith, consistent with the largest decreases in trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P) levels (2- to 3-fold) being found in pith and florets. Low T6P led to decreased gene expression for primary metabolism and increased gene expression for secondary metabolism, particularly lipid-related pathways. Despite similar changes in gene expression, the pith and floret displayed opposing assimilate profiles: sugars, sugar phosphates, amino acids, and lipids increased in florets, but decreased in pith. Possibly explaining this assimilate distribution, seven <i>SWEET</i> genes were found to be up-regulated in the transgenic plants. SnRK1 activity and the expression of the gene for the SnRK1 beta subunit, expression of SnRK1 marker genes, and endogenous trehalose pathway genes were also altered. Furthermore, leaves of the transgenic maize maintained a higher photosynthetic rate for a longer period compared to wild type. In conclusion, we found that decreasing T6P in reproductive tissues down-regulates primary metabolism and up-regulates secondary metabolism, resulting in different metabolite profiles in component tissues. Our data implicate T6P/ SnRK1 as a major regulator of whole-plant resource allocation for crop yield improvement.</p>

Xylem Sap Surface Tension May Be Crucial for Hydraulic Safety
<p>The surface tension (γ) of xylem sap plays a key role in stabilizing air-water interfaces at the pits between water- and gas-filled conduits to avoid air seeding at low water potentials. We studied seasonal changes in xylem sap γ in <i>Picea abies</i> and <i>Pinus mugo</i> growing at the alpine timberline. We analyzed their vulnerability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-induced embolism using solutions of different γ and estimated the potential effect of seasonal changes in γ on hydraulic vulnerability. In both species, xylem sap γ showed distinct seasonal courses between about 50 and 68 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup>. Solutions with low γ caused higher vulnerability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-induced xylem embolism. The water potential at 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity in <i>P. abies</i> and <i>P. mugo</i> was −3.35 and −3.86 MPa at γ of 74 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup> but −2.11 and −2.09 MPa at 45 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup>. This indicates up to about 1 MPa seasonal variation in 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity. The results revealed pronounced effects of changes in xylem sap γ on the hydraulic safety of trees in situ. These effects also are relevant in vulnerability analyses, where the use of standard solutions with high γ overestimates hydraulic safety. Thus, γ should be considered carefully in hydraulic studies.</p>

Abscisic Acid Down-Regulates Hydraulic Conductance of Grapevine Leaves in Isohydric Genotypes Only<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plants evolved different strategies to cope with water stress. While isohydric species maintain their midday leaf water potential (Ψ<sub>M</sub>) under soil water deficit by closing their stomata, anisohydric species maintain higher stomatal aperture and exhibit substantial reductions in Ψ<sub>M</sub>. It was hypothesized that isohydry is related to a locally higher sensitivity of stomata to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-hormone abscisic acid (ABA). Interestingly, recent lines of evidence in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) suggested that stomatal responsiveness is also controlled by an ABA action on leaf water supply upstream from stomata. Here, we tested the possibility in grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) that different genotypes ranging from near isohydric to more anisohydric may have different sensitivities in these ABA responses. Measurements on whole plants in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> conditions were combined with assays on detached leaves fed with ABA. Two different methods consistently showed that leaf hydraulic conductance (K<sub>leaf</sub>) was down-regulated by exogenous ABA, with strong variations depending on the genotype. Importantly, variation between isohydry and anisohydry correlated with K<sub>leaf</sub> sensitivity to ABA, with K<sub>leaf</sub> in the most anisohydric genotypes being unresponsive to the hormone. We propose that the observed response of K<sub>leaf</sub> to ABA may be part of the overall ABA regulation of leaf water status.</p>

Cuticle Biosynthesis in Tomato Leaves Is Developmentally Regulated by Abscisic Acid
<p>The expansion of aerial organs in plants is coupled with the synthesis and deposition of a hydrophobic cuticle, composed of cutin and waxes, which is critically important in limiting water loss. While the abiotic stress-related hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is known to up-regulate wax accumulation in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, the hormonal regulation of cuticle biosynthesis during organ ontogeny is poorly understood. To address the hypothesis that ABA also mediates cuticle formation during organ development, we assessed the effect of ABA deficiency on cuticle formation in three ABA biosynthesis-impaired tomato mutants. The mutant leaf cuticles were thinner, had structural abnormalities, and had a substantial reduction in levels of cutin. ABA deficiency also consistently resulted in differences in the composition of leaf cutin and cuticular waxes. Exogenous application of ABA partially rescued these phenotypes, confirming that they were a consequence of reduced ABA levels. The ABA mutants also showed reduced expression of genes involved in cutin or wax formation. This difference was again countered by exogenous ABA, further indicating regulation of cuticle biosynthesis by ABA. The fruit cuticles were affected differently by the ABA-associated mutations, but in general were thicker. However, no structural abnormalities were observed, and the cutin and wax compositions were less affected than in leaf cuticles, suggesting that ABA action influences cuticle formation in an organ-dependent manner. These results suggest dual roles for ABA in regulating leaf cuticle formation: one that is fundamentally associated with leaf expansion, independent of abiotic stress, and another that is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> induced.</p>

Evidence for Hydraulic Vulnerability Segmentation and Lack of Xylem Refilling under Tension
<p>The vascular system of grapevine (<i>Vitis</i> spp.) has been reported as being highly vulnerable, even though grapevine regularly experiences seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>. Consequently, stomata would remain open below water potentials that would generate a high loss of stem hydraulic conductivity via xylem embolism. This situation would necessitate daily cycles of embolism repair to restore hydraulic function. However, a more parsimonious explanation is that some hydraulic techniques are prone to artifacts in species with long vessels, leading to the overestimation of vulnerability. The aim of this study was to provide an unbiased assessment of (1) the vulnerability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-induced embolism in perennial and annual organs and (2) the ability to refill embolized vessels in two <i>Vitis</i> species X-ray micro-computed tomography observations of intact plants indicated that both <i>Vitis</i> <i>vinifera</i> and <i>Vitis</i> <i>riparia</i> were relatively vulnerable, with the pressure inducing 50% loss of stem hydraulic conductivity = −1.7 and −1.3 MPa, respectively. In <i>V. vinifera</i>, both the stem and petiole had similar sigmoidal vulnerability curves but differed in pressure inducing 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity (−1.7 and −1 MPa for stem and petiole, respectively). Refilling was not observed as long as bulk xylem pressure remained negative (e.g. at the apical part of the plants; −0.11 ± 0.02 MPa) and change in percentage loss of conductivity was 0.02% ± 0.01%. However, positive xylem pressure was observed at the basal part of the plant (0.04 ± 0.01 MPa), leading to a recovery of conductance (change in percentage loss of conductivity = −0.24% ± 0.12%). Our findings provide evidence that grapevine is unable to repair embolized xylem vessels under negative pressure, but its hydraulic vulnerability segmentation provides significant protection of the perennial stem.</p>

Experimental analysis of the liquid-feeding mechanism of the butterfly <i>Pieris rapae</i>
<p>The butterfly <i>Pieirs rapae</i> drinks liquid using a long proboscis. A high pressure gradient is induced in the proboscis when cibarial pump muscles contract. However, liquid feeding through the long proboscis poses a disadvantage of high flow resistance. Hence, butterflies may possess special features to compensate for this disadvantage and succeed in foraging. The main objective of this study is to analyze the liquid-feeding mechanism of butterflies. The systaltic motion of the cibarial pump organ was visualized using the synchrotron X-ray imaging technique. In addition, an ellipsoidal pump model was established based on synchrotron X-ray micro-computed tomography. To determine the relationship between the cyclic variation of the pump volume and the liquid-feeding flow, velocity fields of the intake flow at the tip of the proboscis were measured using micro-particle image velocimetry. Reynolds and Womersley numbers of liquid-feeding flow in the proboscis were ~1.40 and 0.129, respectively. The liquid-feeding flow could be characterized as a quasi-steady state laminar flow. Considering these results, we analyzed the dimensions of the feeding apparatus on the basis of minimum energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consumpt</span></strong>ion during the liquid-feeding process. The relationship between the proboscis and the cibarial pump was determined when minimum energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consumpt</span></strong>ion occurs. As a result, the volume of the cibarial pump is proportional to the cube of the radius of the proboscis. It seems that the liquid-feeding system of butterflies and other long-proboscid insects follow the cube relationship. The present results provide insights into the feeding strategies of liquid-feeding butterflies.</p>

The cost of muscle power production: muscle oxygen consumption per unit work increases at low temperatures in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>
<p>Metabolic energy (ATP) supply to muscle is essential to support activity and behaviour. It is expected, therefore, that there is strong selection to maximise muscle power output for a given rate of ATP use. However, the viscosity and stiffness of muscle increases with a decrease in temperature, which means that more ATP may be required to achieve a given work output. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ATP use increases at lower temperatures for a given power output in <i>Xenopus laevis.</i> To account for temperature variation at different time scales, we considered the interaction between acclimation for 4 weeks (to 15 or 25°C) and acute exposure to these temperatures. Cold-acclimated frogs had greater sprint speed at 15°C than warm-acclimated animals. However, acclimation temperature did not affect isolated gastrocnemius muscle biomechanics. Isolated muscle produced greater tetanus force, and faster isometric force generation and relaxation, and generated more work loop power at 25°C than at 15°C acute test temperature. Oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consumpt</span></strong>ion of isolated muscle at rest did not change with test temperature, but oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consumpt</span></strong>ion while muscle was performing work was significantly higher at 15°C than at 25°C, regardless of acclimation conditions. Muscle therefore consumed significantly more oxygen at 15°C for a given work output than at 25°C, and plastic responses did not modify this thermodynamic effect. The metabolic cost of muscle performance and activity therefore increased with a decrease in temperature. To maintain activity across a range of temperature, animals must increase ATP production or face an allocation trade-off at lower temperatures. Our data demonstrate the potential energetic benefits of warming up muscle before activity, which is seen in diverse groups of animals such as bees, which warm flight muscle before take-off, and humans performing warm ups before exercise.</p>
