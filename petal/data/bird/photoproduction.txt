A single-photon switch and transistor enabled by a solid-state quantum memory
<p>Single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> switches and transistors generate strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> interactions that are essential for quantum circuits and networks. However, the deterministic control of an optical signal with a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> requires strong interactions with a quantum memory, which has been challenging to achieve in a solid-state platform. We demonstrate a single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> switch and transistor enabled by a solid-state quantum memory. Our device consists of a semiconductor spin qubit strongly coupled to a nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic cavity. The spin qubit enables a single 63-picosecond gate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> to switch a signal field containing up to an average of 27.7 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s before the internal state of the device resets. Our results show that semiconductor nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic devices can produce strong and controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> interactions that could enable high-bandwidth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic quantum information processing.</p>

Observation of three-photon bound states in a quantum nonlinear medium
<p>Bound states of massive particles, such as nuclei, atoms, or molecules, constitute the bulk of the visible world around us. By contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s typically only interact weakly. We report the observation of traveling three-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> bound states in a quantum nonlinear medium where the interactions between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s are mediated by atomic Rydberg states. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> correlation and conditional phase measurements reveal the distinct bunching and phase features associated with three-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> and two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> bound states. Such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic trimers and dimers possess shape-preserving wave functions that depend on the constituent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> number. The observed bunching and strongly nonlinear optical phase are described by an effective field theory of Rydberg-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> interactions. These observations demonstrate the ability to realize and control strongly interacting quantum many-body states of light.</p>

Deterministic generation of a cluster state of entangled photons
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic cluster states are a resource for quantum computation based solely on single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> measurements. We use semiconductor quantum dots to deterministically generate long strings of polarization-entangled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s in a cluster state by periodic timed excitation of a precessing matter qubit. In each period, an entangled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> is added to the cluster state formed by the matter qubit and the previously emitted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s. In our prototype device, the qubit is the confined dark exciton, and it produces strings of hundreds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s in which the entanglement persists over five sequential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s. The measured process map characterizing the device has a fidelity of 0.81 with that of an ideal device. Further feasible improvements of this device may reduce the resources needed for optical quantum information processing.</p>

An integrated diamond nanophotonics platform for quantum-optical networks
<p>Efficient interfaces between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s and quantum emitters form the basis for quantum networks and enable optical nonlinearities at the single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> level. We demonstrate an integrated platform for scalable quantum nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ics based on silicon-vacancy (SiV) color centers coupled to diamond nanodevices.

We control the switch using SiV metastable states and observe optical switching at the single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> level. Raman transitions are used to realize a single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> source with a tunable frequency and bandwidth in a diamond waveguide.

Strongly correlated quantum walks with a 12-qubit superconducting processor
<p>Quantum walks are the quantum analogs of classical random walks, which allow for the simulation of large-scale quantum many-body systems and the realization of universal quantum computation without time-dependent control. We experimentally demonstrate quantum walks of one and two strongly correlated microwave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s in a one-dimensional array of 12 superconducting qubits with short-range interactions. First, in one-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> quantum walks, we observed the propagation of the density and correlation of the quasiparticle excitation of the superconducting qubit and quantum entanglement between qubit pairs. Second, when implementing two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> quantum walks by exciting two superconducting qubits, we observed the fermionization of strongly interacting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s from the measured time-dependent long-range anticorrelations, representing the antibunching of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s with attractive interactions. The demonstration of quantum walks on a quantum processor, using superconducting qubits as artificial atoms and tomographic readout, paves the way to quantum simulation of many-body phenomena and universal quantum computation.</p>

Quantum entanglement of the spin and orbital angular momentum of photons using metamaterials

Imaging CF<sub>3</sub>I conical intersection and photodissociation dynamics with ultrafast electron diffraction
<p>Conical intersections play a critical role in excited-state dynamics of polyatomic molecules because they govern the reaction pathways of many nonadiabatic processes. However, ultrafast probes have lacked sufficient spatial resolution to image wave-packet trajectories through these intersections directly. Here, we present the simultaneous experimental characterization of one-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> and two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> excitation channels in isolated CF<sub>3</sub>I molecules using ultrafast gas-phase electron diffraction. In the two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> channel, we have mapped out the real-space trajectories of a coherent nuclear wave packet, which bifurcates onto two potential energy surfaces when passing through a conical intersection. In the one-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> channel, we have resolved excitation of both the umbrella and the breathing vibrational modes in the CF<sub>3</sub> fragment in multiple nuclear dimensions. These findings benchmark and validate ab initio nonadiabatic dynamics calculations.</p>

Observation of chiral zero mode in inhomogeneous three-dimensional Weyl metamaterials
<p>Owing to the chirality of Weyl nodes, the Weyl systems can support one-way chiral zero modes under a strong magnetic field, which leads to nonconservation of chiral currents—the so-called chiral anomaly. Although promising for robust transport of optical information, the zero chiral bulk modes have not been observed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ics. Here we design an inhomogeneous Weyl metamaterial in which a gauge field is generated for the Weyl nodes by engineering the individual unit cells. We experimentally confirm the presence of the gauge field and observe the zero-order chiral Landau level with one-way propagation. Without breaking the time-reversal symmetry, our system provides a route for designing an artificial magnetic field in three-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic Weyl systems and may have potential for device applications in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ics.</p>

Quantum metasurface for multiphoton interference and state reconstruction
<p>Metasurfaces based on resonant nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic structures have enabled innovative types of flat-optics devices that often outperform the capabilities of bulk components, yet these advances remain largely unexplored for quantum applications. We show that nonclassical multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> interferences can be achieved at the subwavelength scale in all-dielectric metasurfaces. We simultaneously image multiple projections of quantum states with a single metasurface, enabling a robust reconstruction of amplitude, phase, coherence, and entanglement of multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> polarization-encoded states. One- and two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> states are reconstructed through nonlocal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> correlation measurements with polarization-insensitive click detectors positioned after the metasurface, and the scalability to higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> numbers is established theoretically.

A silicon Brillouin laser
<p>Brillouin laser oscillators offer powerful and flexible dynamics as the basis for mode-locked lasers, microwave oscillators, and optical gyroscopes in a variety of optical systems.

In this study, we have harnessed these engineered nonlinearities to demonstrate Brillouin lasing in silicon.

Strong spin-photon coupling in silicon
<p>Long coherence times of single spins in silicon quantum dots make these systems highly attractive for quantum computation, but how to scale up spin qubit systems remains an open question.

The electron spin is trapped in a silicon double quantum dot, and the microwave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> is stored in an on-chip high-impedance superconducting resonator. The electric field component of the cavity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> couples directly to the charge dipole of the electron in the double dot, and indirectly to the electron spin, through a strong local magnetic field gradient from a nearby micromagnet.

Disorder-induced optical transition from spin Hall to random Rashba effect

Weak disorder induces a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic spin Hall effect, observed via quantum weak measurements, whereas strong disorder leads to spin-split modes in momentum space, a random optical Rashba effect. Study of the momentum space entropy reveals an optical transition upon reaching a critical point where the structure’s anisotropy axis vanishes. Incorporation of singular topology into the disordered structure demonstrates repulsive vortex interaction depending on the disorder strength.

Nonreciprocal lasing in topological cavities of arbitrary geometries

Satellite-based entanglement distribution over 1200 kilometers

Nanometer resolution imaging and tracking of fluorescent molecules with minimal photon fluxes

MINFLUX tracking of single fluorescent proteins increased the temporal resolution and the number of localizations per trace by a factor of 100, as demonstrated with diffusing 30<i>S</i> ribosomal subunits in living <i>Escherichia coli</i>.

Quantum optical circulator controlled by a single chirally coupled atom

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in optically dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to scattering and absorption. Consequently, externally measured effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how measured distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally measured quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one side of thallus cross sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with laser light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable chlorophyll fluorescence from cross sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for using chlorophyll fluorescence profiles in combination with integrating sphere measurements of reflectance and transmittance to calculate depth-resolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> absorption profiles, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s absorbed by PSII. Absorption profiles of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically observed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> absorption via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

The role of light in mediating the effects of ocean acidification on coral calcification
<p>We tested the effect of light and <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> on the calcification and survival of <i>Pocillopora damicornis</i> recruits settled from larvae released in southern Taiwan. In March 2011, recruits were incubated at 31, 41, 70, 122 and 226 μmol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> under ambient (493 μatm) and high <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> (878 μatm). After 5 days, calcification was measured gravimetrically and survivorship estimated as the number of living recruits. Calcification was affected by the interaction of <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> with light, and at 493 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> the response to light intensity resembled a positive parabola. At 878 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, the effect of light on calcification differed from that observed at 493 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, with the result that there were large differences in calcification between 493 μatm and 878 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> at intermediate light intensities (<i>ca</i>. 70 μmol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), but similar rates of calcification at the highest and lowest light intensities. Survivorship was affected by light and <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, and was highest at 122 μmol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> in both <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> treatments, but was unrelated to calcification. In June 2012 the experiment was repeated, and again the results suggested that exposure to high <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> decreased calcification of <i>P. damicornis</i> recruits at intermediate light intensities, but not at lower or higher intensities. Together, our findings demonstrate that the effect of <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> on coral recruits can be light dependent, with inhibitory effects of high <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> on calcification at intermediate light intensities that disappear at both higher and lower light intensities.</p>

Ideal Weyl points and helicoid surface states in artificial photonic crystal structures

Coherent single-atom superradiance
<p>Superradiance is a quantum phenomenon emerging in macroscopic systems whereby correlated single atoms cooperatively emit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s. Demonstration of controlled collective atom-field interactions has resulted from the ability to directly imprint correlations with an atomic ensemble. Here we report cavity-mediated coherent single-atom superradiance: Single atoms with predefined correlation traverse a high–quality factor cavity one by one, emitting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s cooperatively with the <i>N</i> atoms that have already gone through the cavity (<i>N</i> represents the number of atoms). Enhanced collective photoemission of <i>N</i>-squared dependence was observed even when the intracavity atom number was less than unity. The correlation among single atoms was achieved by nanometer-precision position control and phase-aligned state manipulation of atoms by using a nanohole-array aperture. Our results demonstrate a platform for phase-controlled atom-field interactions.</p>

Nanophotonic rare-earth quantum memory with optically controlled retrieval
<p>Optical quantum memories are essential elements in quantum networks for long-distance distribution of quantum entanglement. Scalable development of quantum network nodes requires on-chip qubit storage functionality with control of the readout time. We demonstrate a high-fidelity nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic quantum memory based on a mesoscopic neodymium ensemble coupled to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic crystal cavity. The nanocavity enables >95% spin polarization for efficient initialization of the atomic frequency comb memory and time bin–selective readout through an enhanced optical Stark shift of the comb frequencies.

Soft x-ray excitonics

This attosecond x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (AXANES) technique enables direct probing of the excitons’ quasiparticle character, tracking of their subfemtosecond relaxation, the measurement of excitonic polarizability, and observation of dark core-excitonic states. Direct measurement and control of core-excitons in solids lay the foundation of x-ray excitonics.</p>

Demonstration of an ac Josephson junction laser
<p>Superconducting electronic devices have reemerged as contenders for both classical and quantum computing due to their fast operation speeds, low dissipation, and long coherence times. An ultimate demonstration of coherence is lasing. We use one of the fundamental aspects of superconductivity, the ac Josephson effect, to demonstrate a laser made from a Josephson junction strongly coupled to a multimode superconducting cavity. A dc voltage bias applied across the junction provides a source of microwave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s, and the circuit’s nonlinearity allows for efficient down-conversion of higher-order Josephson frequencies to the cavity’s fundamental mode. The simple fabrication and operation allows for easy integration with a range of quantum devices, allowing for efficient on-chip generation of coherent microwave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s at low temperatures.</p>

Buffer-gas cooling of antiprotonic helium to 1.5 to 1.7 K, and antiproton-to–electron mass ratio
<p>Charge, parity, and time reversal (CPT) symmetry implies that a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass. The antiproton-to-electron mass ratio [Formula] can be precisely determined from the single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> transition frequencies of antiprotonic helium. We measured 13 such frequencies with laser spectroscopy to a fractional precision of 2.5 × 10<sup>−9</sup> to 16 × 10<sup>−9</sup>. About 2 × 10<sup>9</sup> antiprotonic helium atoms were cooled to temperatures between 1.5 and 1.7 kelvin by using buffer-gas cooling in cryogenic low-pressure helium gas; the narrow thermal distribution led to the observation of sharp spectral lines of small thermal Doppler width. The deviation between the experimental frequencies and the results of three-body quantum electrodynamics calculations was reduced by a factor of 1.4 to 10 compared with previous single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> experiments. From this, [Formula] was determined as 1836.1526734(15), which agrees with a recent proton-to-electron experimental value within 8 × 10<sup>−10</sup>.</p>

Imaging of pure spin-valley diffusion current in WS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub> heterostructures
<p>Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials are promising for spintronic and valleytronic applications because valley-polarized excitations can be generated and manipulated with circularly polarized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s and the valley and spin degrees of freedom are locked by strong spin-orbital interactions. In this study we demonstrate efficient generation of a pure and locked spin-valley diffusion current in tungsten disulfide (WS<sub>2</sub>)–tungsten diselenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>) heterostructures without any driving electric field. We imaged the propagation of valley current in real time and space by pump-probe spectroscopy. The valley current in the heterostructures can live for more than 20 microseconds and propagate over 20 micrometers; both the lifetime and the diffusion length can be controlled through electrostatic gating. The high-efficiency and electric-field–free generation of a locked spin-valley current in TMDC heterostructures holds promise for applications in spin and valley devices.</p>

Measurement of the fine-structure constant as a test of the Standard Model

Using multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> interactions (Bragg diffraction and Bloch oscillations), we demonstrate the largest phase (12 million radians) of any Ramsey-Bordé interferometer and control systematic effects at a level of 0.12 part per billion.

Topological insulator laser: Experiments

Recent years have witnessed intense efforts toward exploiting these phenomena in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ics. Here we demonstrate a nonmagnetic topological insulator laser system exhibiting topologically protected transport in the cavity. Its topological properties give rise to single-mode lasing, robustness against defects, and considerably higher slope efficiencies compared to the topologically trivial counterparts. We further exploit the properties of active topological platforms by assembling the system from <i>S</i>-chiral microresonators, enforcing predetermined unidirectional lasing without magnetic fields.

<p>Metasurfaces with strongly anisotropic optical properties can support deep subwavelength-scale confined electromagnetic waves (polaritons), which promise opportunities for controlling light in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic and optoelectronic applications. We developed a mid-infrared hyperbolic metasurface by nanostructuring a thin layer of hexagonal boron nitride that supports deep subwavelength-scale phonon polaritons that propagate with in-plane hyperbolic dispersion. By applying an infrared nanoimaging technique, we visualize the concave (anomalous) wavefronts of a diverging polariton beam, which represent a landmark feature of hyperbolic polaritons. The results illustrate how near-field microscopy can be applied to reveal the exotic wavefronts of polaritons in anisotropic materials and demonstrate that nanostructured van der Waals materials can form a highly variable and compact platform for hyperbolic infrared metasurface devices and circuits.</p>

Soliton microcomb range measurement

Coherent laser ranging systems using dual-frequency combs provide an unprecedented combination of long range, high precision, and fast update rate. We report dual-comb distance measurement using chip-based soliton microcombs. A single pump laser was used to generate dual-frequency combs within a single microresonator as counterpropagating solitons. We demonstrated time-of-flight measurement with 200-nanometer precision at an averaging time of 500 milliseconds within a range ambiguity of 16 millimeters. Measurements at distances up to 25 meters with much lower precision were also performed.

Spatial reconstruction of immune niches by combining photoactivatable reporters and scRNA-seq
<p>Cellular functions are strongly dependent on surrounding cells and environmental factors.

We developed a method, NICHE-seq, that combines photoactivatable fluorescent reporters, two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> microscopy, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to infer the cellular and molecular composition of niches. We applied NICHE-seq to examine the high-order assembly of immune cell networks.

This study establishes NICHE-seq as a broadly applicable method for elucidating high-order spatial organization of cell types and their molecular pathways.</p>

Giant nonlinear response at a plasmonic nanofocus drives efficient four-wave mixing
<p>Efficient optical frequency mixing typically must accumulate over large interaction lengths because nonlinear responses in natural materials are inherently weak. This limits the efficiency of mixing processes owing to the requirement of phase matching. Here, we report efficient four-wave mixing (FWM) over micrometer-scale interaction lengths at telecommunications wavelengths on silicon. We used an integrated plasmonic gap waveguide that strongly confines light within a nonlinear organic polymer. The gap waveguide intensifies light by nanofocusing it to a mode cross-section of a few tens of nanometers, thus generating a nonlinear response so strong that efficient FWM accumulates over wavelength-scale distances. This technique opens up nonlinear optics to a regime of relaxed phase matching, with the possibility of compact, broadband, and efficient frequency mixing integrated with silicon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ics.</p>

Structural insights into ion conduction by channelrhodopsin 2
<p>The light-gated ion channel channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) from <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is a major optogenetic tool. Photon absorption starts a well-characterized photocycle, but the structural basis for the regulation of channel opening remains unclear. We present high-resolution structures of ChR2 and the C128T mutant, which has a markedly increased open-state lifetime. The structure reveals two cavities on the intracellular side and two cavities on the extracellular side. They are connected by extended hydrogen-bonding networks involving water molecules and side-chain residues. Central is the retinal Schiff base that controls and synchronizes three gates that separate the cavities. Separate from this network is the DC gate that comprises a water-mediated bond between C128 and D156 and interacts directly with the retinal Schiff base. Comparison with the C128T structure reveals a direct connection of the DC gate to the central gate and suggests how the gating mechanism is affected by subtle tuning of the Schiff base’s interactions.</p>

Spectral narrowing of x-ray pulses for precision spectroscopy with nuclear resonances
<p>Spectroscopy of nuclear resonances offers a wide range of applications due to the remarkable energy resolution afforded by their narrow linewidths. However, progress toward higher resolution is inhibited at modern x-ray sources because they deliver only a tiny fraction of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s on resonance, with the remainder contributing to an off-resonant background. We devised an experimental setup that uses the fast mechanical motion of a resonant target to manipulate the spectrum of a given x-ray pulse and to redistribute off-resonant spectral intensity onto the resonance. As a consequence, the resonant pulse brilliance is increased while the off-resonant background is reduced. Because our method is compatible with existing and upcoming pulsed x-ray sources, we anticipate that this approach will find applications that require ultranarrow x-ray resonances.</p>

Using two freely propagating surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) interfering on a lossy beam splitter, we show that the presence of loss enables us to modify the reflection and transmission factors of the beam splitter, thus revealing quantum interference paths that do not exist in a lossless configuration. We investigate the two-plasmon interference on beam splitters with different sets of reflection and transmission factors. Through coincidence-detection measurements, we observe either coalescence or anti-coalescence of SPPs.

Breaking Lorentz reciprocity to overcome the time-bandwidth limit in physics and engineering
<p>A century-old tenet in physics and engineering asserts that any type of system, having bandwidth Δω, can interact with a wave over only a constrained time period Δ<i>t</i> inversely proportional to the bandwidth (Δ<i>t</i>·Δω ~ 2π). This law severely limits the generic capabilities of all types of resonant and wave-guiding systems in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ics, cavity quantum electrodynamics and optomechanics, acoustics, continuum mechanics, and atomic and optical physics but is thought to be completely fundamental, arising from basic Fourier reciprocity. We propose that this “fundamental” limit can be overcome in systems where Lorentz reciprocity is broken. As a system becomes more asymmetric in its transport properties, the degree to which the limit can be surpassed becomes greater. By way of example, we theoretically demonstrate how, in an astutely designed magnetized semiconductor heterostructure, the above limit can be exceeded by orders of magnitude by using realistic material parameters. Our findings revise prevailing paradigms for linear, time-invariant resonant systems, challenging the doctrine that high-quality resonances must invariably be narrowband and providing the possibility of developing devices with unprecedentedly high time-bandwidth performance.</p>

Coherent imaging of an attosecond electron wave packet

Two-color, two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> ionization via a Stark-shifted intermediate state creates an almost pure f-wave with a magnetic quantum number of zero.

Ring attractor dynamics in the <i>Drosophila</i> central brain
<p>Ring attractors are a class of recurrent networks hypothesized to underlie the representation of heading direction. Such network structures, schematized as a ring of neurons whose connectivity depends on their heading preferences, can sustain a bump-like activity pattern whose location can be updated by continuous shifts along either turn direction. We recently reported that a population of fly neurons represents the animal’s heading via bump-like activity dynamics. We combined two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> calcium imaging in head-fixed flying flies with optogenetics to overwrite the existing population representation with an artificial one, which was then maintained by the circuit with naturalistic dynamics.

Processes and endfeet displayed frequent fast activity, whereas the soma was infrequently active.
