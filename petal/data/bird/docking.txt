Morphology, muscle capacity, skill, and maneuvering ability in hummingbirds
<p>How does agility evolve? This question is challenging because natural movement has many degrees of freedom and can be influenced by multiple traits. We used computer vision to record thousands of translations, rotations, and turns from more than 200 hummingbirds from 25 species, revealing that distinct performance metrics are correlated and that species diverge in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">maneuv</span></strong>ering style. Our analysis demonstrates that the enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">maneuv</span></strong>erability of larger species is explained by their proportionately greater muscle capacity and lower wing loading. Fast acceleration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">maneuv</span></strong>ers evolve by recruiting changes in muscle capacity, whereas fast rotations and sharp turns evolve by recruiting changes in wing morphology. Both species and individuals use turns that play to their strengths. These results demonstrate how both skill and biomechanical traits shape <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">maneuv</span></strong>ering behavior.</p>

A tailless aerial robotic flapper reveals that flies use torque coupling in rapid banked turns
<p>Insects are among the most agile natural flyers. Hypotheses on their flight control cannot always be validated by experiments with animals or tethered robots. To this end, we developed a programmable and agile autonomous free-flying robot controlled through bio-inspired motion changes of its flapping wings. Despite being 55 times the size of a fruit fly, the robot can accurately mimic the rapid escape <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">maneuv</span></strong>ers of flies, including a correcting yaw rotation toward the escape heading. Because the robot’s yaw control was turned off, we showed that these yaw rotations result from passive, translation-induced aerodynamic coupling between the yaw torque and the roll and pitch torques produced throughout the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">maneuv</span></strong>er. The robot enables new methods for studying animal flight, and its flight characteristics allow for real-world flight missions.</p>

Acclimation of <i>Betula alleghaniensis</i> Britton to moderate soil water deficit: small morphological changes make for important consequences in crown display
<p>In the context of the predicted increasing frequency of summer droughts in the northeastern deciduous forest of North America due to climate change, we investigated the acclimation capacity of yellow birch, an economically important native tree species, to soil water deficit. We carried out an integrated examination of allocation of biomass, leaf physiology, branching pattern and in situ 3D crown display. Potted seedlings were subjected to moderate soil water deficit for four consecutive months during their second growing season. Individuals under soil water deficit showed a 40% decrease in biomass accumulation but no change in the relative allocation of biomass to the different plant compartments. Net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates at leaf level decreased under water deficit (~15%) but could not alone explain the total reduction in growth, excluding the carbon starvation hypothesis. The observed reduction in net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates was related to a decrease in stomatal conductance and chlorophyll content. <i>STAR</i><sub>zen</sub> (in situ silhouette to total leaf area ratio; a proxy for light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intercept</span></strong>ion efficiency) decreased under soil water deficit due to shifts in biomass allocation within the branch compartment from long upper axes to short bottom axes. Despite the fact that the understanding of the processes involved in growth reduction and branching pattern alteration will need more attention in future research, we conclude that under water deficit yellow birch at young stages will: (i) experience a substantial loss of growth and biomass; and (ii) acclimate through architectural plasticity rather than through changes in the relative allocation of root biomass to enhance its water management.</p>

RNA localization feeds translation
<p>The digestive tract has to cope with the challenge of functioning efficiently despite irregular cycles of eating and fasting. Digestion and absorption of nutrients require large quantities of proteins, mainly enzymes and transporters (<i>1</i>). Although these proteins must be available in the epithelial cells that line the stomach and intestines within minutes upon feeding, their continuous production would impose high upkeep costs on the fasting organism. On page 1299 of this issue, Moor <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) identify a mechanism that may account for the responsiveness of the digestive system: The monolayer of enterocytes (which form the intestinal epithelium) controls protein expression at the level of translation, through regulated RNA localization.</p>

Hydraulic control of tuna fins: A role for the lymphatic system in vertebrate locomotion
<p>The lymphatic system in teleost fish has genetic and developmental origins similar to those of the mammalian lymphatic system, which is involved in immune response and fluid homeostasis. Here, we show that the lymphatic system of tunas functions in swimming hydrodynamics. Specifically, a musculo-vascular complex, consisting of fin muscles, bones, and lymphatic vessels, is involved in the hydraulic control of median fins. This specialization of the lymphatic system is associated with fish in the family Scombridae and may have evolved in response to the demand for swimming and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">maneuv</span></strong>ering control in these high-performance species.</p>

Outcomes after early return to theatre following hip hemiarthroplasty for intracapsular fracture of the femoral neck
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Hip hemiarthroplasty is a standard treatment for intracapsular   proximal femoral fractures in the frail elderly. In this study we   have explored the implications of early return to theatre, within   30 days, on patient outcome following hip hemiarthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively reviewed the hospital records of all hip hemiarthroplasties   performed in our unit between January 2010 and January 2015. Demographic   details, medical backround, details of the primary procedure, complications,   subsequent procedures requiring return to theatre, re-admissions,   discharge destination and death were collected.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 705 procedures were included; 428 Austin Moore and   277 Exeter Trauma Stems were used. A total of 34 fractures (in 33   patients) required early return to theatre within 30 days. Age,   gender, laterality, time from admission to primary procedure, American   Society of Anesthesiologists grade, and implant type were similar   for those requiring early return to theatre and those who did not.   Early return to theatre was associated with a significantly higher   length of stay (mean 33.6 days (7 to 107) <i>versus</i> 18.6   days (0 to 152), p < 0.001), re-admission rate (38.2% <i>versus</i> 8.6%,   p < 0.001), and subsequent revision rate (17.6% <i>versus</i> 1.3%,   p < 0.001). We found no difference in level of care required   on discharge or mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Proximal femoral fractures are common in the elderly population,   with far-reaching medical and economic implications. Factors such   as infection or dislocation may require early return to theatre,   and this is associated with outcomes which may be both medically   and economically detrimental. This illustrates the importance of   avoiding early complications to improve longer term outcome.</p><p>Return to theatre within 30 days is associated with longer length   of stay, higher re-admission rate, and higher subsequent revision   rate. It may be a useful short-term quality indicator for longer   term outcome measures following hip hemiarthroplasty for intracapsular   fractures of the proximal femur.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:958–63.</p></sec>

Modeling Major Adverse Outcomes of Pediatric and Adult Patients With Congenital Heart Disease Undergoing Cardiac Catheterization
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Risk standardization for adverse events after congenital cardiac catheterization is needed to equitably compare patient outcomes among different hospitals as a foundation for quality improvement. The goal of this project was to develop a risk-standardization methodology to adjust for patient characteristics when comparing major adverse outcomes in the NCDR’s (National Cardiovascular Data Registry) IMPACT Registry (Improving Pediatric and Adult Congenital Treatment).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between January 2011 and March 2014, 39 725 consecutive patients within IMPACT undergoing cardiac catheterization were identified. Given the heterogeneity of interventional procedures for congenital heart disease, new procedure-type risk categories were derived with empirical data and expert opinion, as were markers of hemodynamic vulnerability. A multivariable hierarchical logistic regression model to identify patient and procedural characteristics predictive of a major adverse event or death after cardiac catheterization was derived in 70% of the cohort and validated in the remaining 30%.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The rate of major adverse event or death was 7.1% and 7.2% in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Six procedure-type risk categories and 6 independent indicators of hemodynamic vulnerability were identified. The final risk adjustment model included procedure-type risk category, number of hemodynamic vulnerability indicators, renal insufficiency, single-ventricle physiology, and coagulation disorder. The model had good discrimination, with a C-statistic of 0.76 and 0.75 in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Model calibration in the validation cohort was excellent, with a slope of 0.97 (standard error, 0.04; <i>P</i> value [for difference from 1] =0.53) and an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intercept</span></strong> of 0.007 (standard error, 0.12; <i>P</i> value [for difference from 0] =0.95).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The creation of a validated risk-standardization model for adverse outcomes after congenital cardiac catheterization can support reporting of risk-adjusted outcomes in the IMPACT Registry as a foundation for quality improvement.</p></sec>
