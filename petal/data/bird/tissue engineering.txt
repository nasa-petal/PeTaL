Rice Morphology Determinant-Mediated Actin Filament Organization Contributes to Pollen Tube Growth
<p>For successful fertilization in angiosperms, rapid tip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in pollen tubes delivers the male gamete into the ovules. The actin-binding protein-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization of the actin cytoskeleton within the pollen tube plays a crucial role in this polarized process. However, the mechanism underlying the polarity of the actin filament (F-actin) array and behaviors in pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that an actin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>izing protein, Rice Morphology Determinant (RMD), a type II formin from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), controls pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> by modulating the polarity and distribution of the F-actin array. The rice <i>rmd</i> mutant exhibits abnormal pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and a decreased germination rate of the pollen grain in vitro and in vivo. The <i>rmd</i> pollen tubes display a dis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ized F-actin pattern with disrupted apical actin density and shank longitudinal cable direction/arrangement, indicating the novel role of RMD in F-actin polarity during tip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Consistent with this role, RMD localizes at the tip of the rice pollen tube, which is essential for pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and polarity as well as F-actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization. Furthermore, the direction and characteristics of the RMD-guided F-actin array positively regulate the deposition of cell wall components and the pattern and velocity of cytoplasmic streaming during rice pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Collectively, our results suggest that RMD is essential for the spatial regulation of pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> via modulating F-actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization and array orientation in rice. This work provides insights into tip-focused cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and polarity.</p>

ABA Suppresses Root Hair Growth via the OBP4 Transcriptional Regulator
<p>Plants modify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and tune morphogenesis in response to various endogenous and environmental cues. At the cellular level, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> is often adjusted by alterations in cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this control remain poorly understood. In this study, we identify the DNA BINDING WITH ONE FINGER (DOF)-type transcription regulator OBF BINDING PROTEIN4 (OBP4) as a repressor of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Ectopic expression of <i>OBP4</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) inhibits cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, resulting in severe dwarfism and the repression of genes involved in the regulation of water transport, root hair development, and stress responses. Among the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors known to control root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, OBP4 binds the <i>ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE6-LIKE2</i> (<i>RSL2</i>) promoter to repress its expression. The accumulation of OBP4 proteins is detected in expanding root epidermal cells, and its expression level is increased by the application of abscisic acid (ABA) at concentrations sufficient to inhibit root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. ABA-dependent induction of <i>OBP4</i> is associated with the reduced expression of <i>RSL2</i>. Furthermore, ectopic expression of <i>OBP4</i> or loss of <i>RSL2</i> function results in ABA-insensitive root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Taken together, our results suggest that OBP4-mediated transcriptional repression of <i>RSL2</i> contributes to the ABA-dependent inhibition of root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in Arabidopsis.</p>

F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for tip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in an array of plant models, including <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that diffusion can transport secretory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during secretion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-based transport is necessary to overcome vesicle transport limitations to sustain secretion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of diffusion, secretion kinetics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in polarized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we first show that secretory vesicles move toward and accumulate at the tip in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle diffusion from actin-mediated transport and measured the diffusion coefficient and concentration of vesicles. Using these values, we constructed a theoretical diffusion-based model for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion kinetics, diffusion could support normal cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rates. We further refined our model to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion kinetics and the size of the secretion zone limit diffusion-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. This model predicts that diffusion-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> is dependent on the size of the region of exocytosis at the tip and that diffusion-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> would be significantly slower than normal cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. To further explore the size of the secretion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the secretion zone is smaller than 6 μm in diameter at the tip. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active transport in polarized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and provide important insight into vesicle secretion during tip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>.</p>

Correlation between genome reduction and bacterial growth
<p>Genome reduction by removing dispensable genomic sequences in bacteria is commonly used in both fundamental and applied studies to determine the minimal genetic requirements for a living system or to develop highly efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bioreactor</span></strong>s. Nevertheless, whether and how the accumulative loss of dispensable genomic sequences disturbs bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> remains unclear. To investigate the relationship between genome reduction and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, a series of <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains carrying genomes reduced in a stepwise manner were used. Intensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> analyses revealed that the accumulation of multiple genomic deletions caused decreases in the exponential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rate and the saturated cell density in a deletion-length-dependent manner as well as gradual changes in the patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> dynamics, regardless of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> media. Accordingly, a perspective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> model linking genome evolution to genome engineering was proposed. This study provides the first demonstration of a quantitative connection between genomic sequence and bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, indicating that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rate is potentially associated with dispensable genomic sequences.</p>

Differential radial growth patterns between beech (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L.) and oak (<i>Quercus robur</i> L.) on periodically waterlogged soils
<p>Climate scenarios for northern Central Europe project rising temperatures and increasing frequency and intensity of droughts but also a shift in precipitation pattern with more humid winters. This in turn may result in soil waterlogging during the following spring, leading to increasing stress for trees growing on hydric sites. The influence of waterlogging on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of common beech and pedunculate oak has been studied intensively on seedlings under experimental conditions. However, the question remains whether results of these studies can be transferred to mature trees growing under natural conditions. To test this, we investigated general <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> patterns and climate–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> relationships in four mature stands of beech and oak growing on hydromorphic soils (Stagnosols) in northeast Germany using dendrochronological methods. Our results confirmed the expected tolerance of oak to strong water-level fluctuations. Neither extremely wet conditions during spring nor summer droughts significantly affected its radial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Oak <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> responded positively to warmer temperatures during previous year October and March of the current year of ring formation. Contrary to our expectations, also beech showed relatively low sensitivity to periods of high soil water saturation. Instead, summer drought turned out to be the main climatic factor influencing ring width of beech even under the specific periodically wet soil conditions of our study. This became evident from general climate–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> correlations over the last century as well as from discontinuous (pointer year) analysis with summer drought being significantly correlated to the occurrence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> depressions. As ring width of the two species is affected by differing climate parameters, species-specific chronologies show no coherence in high-frequency variations even for trees growing in close proximity. We assume differences in rooting depth as the main reason for the differing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> patterns and climate correlations of the two species under study. Our results indicate that under the projected future climate scenarios, beech may suffer from increasing drought stress even on hydromorphic soils. Oak might be able to maintain a sufficient hydraulic status during summer droughts by reaching water in deeper soil strata with its root system. Wet phases with waterlogged soil conditions during spring or summer appear to have only a little direct influence on radial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of both species.</p>

The ADAPTOR PROTEIN-3 Complex Mediates Pollen Tube Growth by Coordinating Vacuolar Targeting and Organization
<p>Pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> is an essential step for successful plant reproduction. Vacuolar trafficking and dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization are important for pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>; however, the key proteins involved in these processes are not well understood. Here, we report that the ADAPTOR PROTEIN-3 (AP-3) complex and its tonoplast cargo PROTEIN S-ACYL TRANSFERASE10 (PAT10) are critical for pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). AP-3 is a heterotetrameric protein complex consisting of four subunits, δ, β, µ, and σ. AP-3 regulates tonoplast targeting of several cargoes, such as PAT10. We show that functional loss of any of the four AP-3 subunits reduces plant fertility. In <i>ap-3</i> mutants, pollen development was normal but pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> was compromised, leading to reduced male transmission. Functional loss of <i>PAT10</i> caused a similar reduction in pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, suggesting that the tonoplast association of PAT10 mediated by AP-3 is crucial for this process. Indeed, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient during pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> was reduced significantly due to <i>AP-3</i> loss of function, consistent with the abnormal targeting of CALCINUERIN B-LIKE2 (CBL2) and CBL3, whose tonoplast association depends on PAT10. Furthermore, we show that the pollen tubes of <i>ap-3</i> mutants have vacuoles with simplified tubules and bulbous structures, indicating that AP-3 affects vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization. Our results demonstrate a role for AP-3 in plant reproduction and provide insights into the role of vacuoles in polarized cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>.</p>

Reduction in Root Secondary Growth as a Strategy for Phosphorus Acquisition
<p>We tested the hypothesis that reduced root secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of dicotyledonous species improves phosphorus acquisition. Functional-structural modeling in SimRoot indicates that, in common bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>), reduced root secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> reduces root metabolic costs, increases root length, improves phosphorus capture, and increases shoot biomass in low-phosphorus soil. Observations from the field and greenhouse confirm that, under phosphorus stress, resource allocation is shifted from secondary to primary root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, genetic variation exists for this response, and reduced secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> improves phosphorus capture from low-phosphorus soil. Under low phosphorus in greenhouse mesocosms, genotypes with reduced secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> had 39% smaller root cross-sectional area, 60% less root respiration, 27% greater root length, 78% greater shoot phosphorus content, and 68% greater shoot mass than genotypes with advanced secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. In the field under low phosphorus, these genotypes had 43% smaller root cross-sectional area, 32% greater root length, 58% greater shoot phosphorus content, and 80% greater shoot mass than genotypes with advanced secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> eliminated arbuscular mycorrhizal associations as cortical tissue was destroyed. These results support the hypothesis that reduced root secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> is an adaptive response to low phosphorus availability and merits investigation as a potential breeding target.</p>

Jasmonic Acid Enhances Al-Induced Root Growth Inhibition<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Phytohormones such as ethylene and auxin are involved in the regulation of the aluminum (Al)-induced root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> inhibition. Although jasmonate (JA) has been reported to play a crucial role in the regulation of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and development in response to environmental stresses through interplay with ethylene and auxin, its role in the regulation of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> response to Al stress is not yet known. In an attempt to elucidate the role of JA, we found that exogenous application of JA enhanced the Al-induced root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> inhibition. Furthermore, phenotype analysis with mutants defective in either JA biosynthesis or signaling suggests that JA is involved in the regulation of Al-induced root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> inhibition. The expression of the JA receptor CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) and the key JA signaling regulator MYC2 was up-regulated in response to Al stress in the root tips. This process together with COI1-mediated Al-induced root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> inhibition under Al stress was controlled by ethylene but not auxin. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that many responsive genes under Al stress were regulated by JA signaling. The differential responsive of microtubule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization-related genes between the wild-type and <i>coi1-2</i> mutant is consistent with the changed depolymerization of cortical microtubules in <i>coi1</i> under Al stress. In addition, ALMT-mediated malate exudation and thus Al exclusion from roots in response to Al stress was also regulated by COI1-mediated JA signaling. Together, this study suggests that root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> inhibition is regulated by COI1-mediated JA signaling independent from auxin signaling and provides novel insights into the phytohormone-mediated root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> inhibition in response to Al stress.</p>

The joint influence of photoperiod and temperature during growth cessation and development of dormancy in white spruce (<i>Picea glauca</i>)
<p>Timely responses to environmental cues enable the synchronization of phenological life-history transitions essential for the health and survival of north-temperate and boreal tree species. While photoperiodic cues will remain persistent under climate change, temperature cues may vary, contributing to possible asynchrony in signals influencing developmental and physiological transitions essential to forest health. Understanding the relative contribution of photoperiod and temperature as determinants of the transition from active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> to dormancy is important for informing adaptive forest management decisions that consider future climates. Using a combination of photoperiod (long = 20 h or short = 8 h day lengths) and temperature (warm = 22 °C/16 °C and cool = 8 °C/4 °C day/night, respectively) treatments, we used microscopy, physiology and modeling to comprehensively examine hallmark traits of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>–dormancy transition—including bud formation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> cessation, cold hardiness and gas exchange—within two provenances of white spruce [<i>Picea glauca</i> (Moench) Voss] spanning a broad latitude in Alberta, Canada. Following exposure to experimental treatments, seedlings were transferred to favorable conditions, and the depth of dormancy was assessed by determining the timing and ability of spruce seedlings to resume <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Short photoperiods promoted bud development and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> cessation, whereas longer photoperiods extended the growing season through the induction of lammas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. In contrast, cool temperatures under both photoperiodic conditions delayed bud development. Photoperiod strongly predicted the development of cold hardiness, whereas temperature predicted photosynthetic rates associated with active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. White spruce was capable of attaining endodormancy, but its release was environmentally determined. Dormancy depth varied substantially across experimental treatments suggesting that environmental cues experienced within one season could affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in the following season, which is particularly important for a determinate species such as white spruce. The joint influence of these environmental cues points toward the importance of including local constant photoperiod and shifting temperature cues into predictive models that consider how climate change may affect northern forests.</p>

A Mobile Auxin Signal Connects Temperature Sensing in Cotyledons with Growth Responses in Hypocotyls
<p>Plants have a remarkable capacity to adjust their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and development to elevated ambient temperatures. Increased elongation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of roots, hypocotyls, and petioles in warm temperatures are hallmarks of seedling thermomorphogenesis. In the last decade, significant progress has been made to identify the molecular signaling components regulating these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> responses. Increased ambient temperature utilizes diverse components of the light sensing and signal transduction network to trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> adjustments. However, it remains unknown whether temperature sensing and responses are universal processes that occur uniformly in all plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s. Alternatively, temperature sensing may be confined to specific tissues or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s, which would require a systemic signal that mediates responses in distal parts of the plant. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings show <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>-specific transcriptome responses to elevated temperatures and that thermomorphogenesis involves both autonomous and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>-interdependent temperature sensing and signaling. Seedling roots can sense and respond to temperature in a shoot-independent manner, whereas shoot temperature responses require both local and systemic processes. The induction of cell elongation in hypocotyls requires temperature sensing in cotyledons, followed by the generation of a mobile auxin signal. Subsequently, auxin travels to the hypocotyl, where it triggers local brassinosteroid-induced cell elongation in seedling stems, which depends upon a distinct, permissive temperature sensor in the hypocotyl.</p>

A Novel Mechanism, Linked to Cell Density, Largely Controls Cell Division in <i>Synechocystis</i>

Here, we investigated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and metabolism of <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 under different nitrogen sources, light intensities, and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Cells grown on urea showed the highest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rates. However, for all conditions tested, the daily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rates in batch cultures decreased steadily over time, and stationary phase was obtained with similar cell densities. Unexpectedly, metabolic and physiological analyses showed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rates during log phase were not controlled primarily by the availability of photoassimilates. Further physiological investigations indicated that nutrient limitation, quorum sensing, light quality, and light intensity (self-shading) were not the main factors responsible for the decrease in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rate and the onset of the stationary phase. Moreover, cell division rates in fed-batch cultures were positively correlated with the dilution rates. Hence, not only light, CO<sub>2</sub>, and nutrients can affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> but also a cell-cell interaction. Accordingly, we propose that cell-cell interaction may be a factor responsible for the gradual decrease of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rates in batch cultures during log phase, culminating with the onset of stationary phase.</p>

Combined effects of defoliation and water stress on pine growth and non-structural carbohydrates
<p>Climate change is expected to increase both pest insect damage and the occurrence of severe drought. There is therefore a need to better understand the combined effects of biotic and abiotic damage on tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in order to predict the multi-factorial effect of climate change on forest ecosystem productivity. Indeed, the effect of stress interactions on tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> is an increasingly important topic that greatly lacks experiments and data, and it is unlikely that the impact of combined stresses can be extrapolated from the outcomes of studies that focused on a single stress. We developed an original manipulative study under real field conditions where we applied artificial defoliation and induced water stress on 10-year-old (∼10 m high) maritime pine trees (<i>Pinus pinaster</i> Ait.). Tree response to combined stresses was quantitatively assessed following tree secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and carbohydrate pools. Such a design allowed us to address the crucial question of combined stresses on trees under stand conditions, sharing soil supplies with neighboring trees. Our initial hypotheses were that (i) moderate defoliation can limit the impact of water stress on tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> through reduced transpiration demand by a tree canopy partly defoliated and that (ii) defoliation results in reduced non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools, affecting tree tolerance to drought. Our results showed additive effects of defoliation and water stress on tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and contradict our initial hypothesis. Indeed, under stand conditions, we found that partial defoliation does not limit the impact of water stress through reduced transpiration. Our study also highlighted that, even if NSC in all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s were affected by defoliation, tree response to water stress was not triggered. We found that stem NSC were maintained or increased during the entire growing season, supporting literature-based hypotheses such as an active maintenance of the hydraulic system or another limiting resource for tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> under defoliation. We also observed a significant decrease in root carbohydrates, which suggests a shift in the root carbon balance under defoliation. The decrease in carbohydrate supply under defoliation may not counterbalance the carbon use for mineral and water uptakes or a translocation to other tissues.</p>

Isoprene Acts as a Signaling Molecule in Gene Networks Important for Stress Responses and Plant Growth
<p>Isoprene synthase converts dimethylallyl diphosphate to isoprene and appears to be necessary and sufficient to allow plants to emit isoprene at significant rates. Isoprene can protect plants from abiotic stress but is not produced naturally by all plants; for example, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) do not produce isoprene. It is typically present at very low concentrations, suggesting a role as a signaling molecule; however, its exact physiological role and mechanism of action are not fully understood. We transformed Arabidopsis with a <i>Eucalyptus globulus isoprene synthase</i>. The regulatory mechanisms of photosynthesis and isoprene emission were similar to those of native emitters, indicating that regulation of isoprene emission is not specific to isoprene-emitting species. Leaf chlorophyll and carotenoid contents were enhanced by isoprene, which also had a marked positive effect on hypocotyl, cotyledon, leaf, and inflorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in Arabidopsis. By contrast, leaf and stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> was reduced in tobacco engineered to emit isoprene. Expression of genes belonging to signaling networks or associated with specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> regulators (e.g. gibberellic acid that promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and jasmonic acid that promotes defense) and genes that lead to stress tolerance was altered by isoprene emission. Isoprene likely executes its effects on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and stress tolerance through direct regulation of gene expression. Enhancement of jasmonic acid-mediated defense signaling by isoprene may trigger a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>-defense tradeoff leading to variations in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> response. Our data support a role for isoprene as a signaling molecule.</p>

<p>The shoot apical meristem (SAM) enables the formation of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s throughout the life of a plant. ERECTA family (ERf) receptors restrict SAM size and promote initiation of leaves while simultaneously supporting establishment of correct phyllotaxy. In the epidermis and during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> elongation ERf activity is regulated by a family of Epidermal Patterning Factor-Like (EPFL) secreted Cys-rich small proteins. Here we show that ERfs play a critical role in communication between the SAM leaf boundary and the central zone in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Ectopic expression of <i>ERECTA</i> in the central zone using the <i>CLAVATA3</i> promoter is sufficient to restrict meristem size and promote leaf initiation. Genetic analysis demonstrated that four putative ligands: EPFL1, EPFL2, EPFL4, and EPFL6 function redundantly in the SAM. These genes are expressed at the SAM-leaf boundary and in the peripheral zone. Previously EPFL4 and EPFL6 have been linked with elongation of aboveground <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s. Here we demonstrate that EPFL1 and EPFL2 promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> elongation as well. In addition, we show that expression of <i>ERECTA</i> in the central zone of the SAM has a strong impact on elongation of internodes and pedicels and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of leaves. These results suggest that ERfs can stimulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> cell nonautonomously.</p>

Control of Adventitious Root Architecture in Rice by Darkness, Light, and Gravity
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) is a semiaquatic plant that is well adapted to partial flooding. Rice stems develop adventitious root (AR) primordia at each node that slowly mature but emerge only when the plant gets flooded, leading to the formation of a whole new secondary root system upon flooding. AR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> is induced by ethylene that accumulates in submerged plant tissues due to its lowered diffusion rate in water. Here, we report that the architecture of the secondary root system in flooded rice plants is controlled not only by altered gas diffusion but also by gravity and light. While ethylene promotes the emergence and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of ARs, gravity and light determine their gravitropic setpoint angle (i.e. the deviation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> direction relative to vertical). ARs grow upward at about 120° in the dark and downward at 54° in the light. The upward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> direction is conserved in <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> rice varieties, suggestive of a conserved trait in rice. Experiments with a klinostat and with inverted stem orientation revealed that gravity promotes upward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> by about 10°. Red, far-red, and blue light lead to negative phototropism in a dose-dependent manner, with blue light being most effective, indicating that phytochrome and blue light signaling control AR system architecture. The <i>cpt1</i> (<i>coleoptile phototropism1</i>) mutant, which lacks one of the phototropin-interacting CPT proteins, shows reduced sensitivity to blue light. Hence, the gravitropic setpoint angle of rice ARs is controlled by genetic and environmental factors that likely balance the need for oxygen supply (upward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>) with avoidance of root desiccation (downward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>).</p>

A Model of Leaf Coordination to Scale-Up Leaf Expansion from the Organ to the Canopy
<p>Process-based crop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> models are popular tools with which to analyze and understand the impact of crop management, genotype-by-environment interactions, or climate change. The ability to predict leaf area development is critical to predict crop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, particularly under conditions of limited resources. Here, we aimed at deciphering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> coordination rules between wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s (i.e. between leaves within a stem, between laminae and sheaths, and between the mainstem and axillary tillers) to model the dynamics of canopy development. We found a unique relationship between laminae area and leaf rank for the mainstem and its tillers, which was robust across a range of sowing dates and plant densities. Robust relationships between laminae and sheath areas also were found, highlighting the tight control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> within and between phytomers. These relationships identified at the phytomer scale were used to develop a simulation model of leaf area dynamics at the canopy level that was integrated in the wheat model SiriusQuality. The model was then evaluated using several independent experiments. The model accurately predicts leaf area dynamics under different scenarios of nitrogen and water limitations. It accounted for 85%, 64%, and 73% of the variability of the surface area of leaf cohorts, total leaf area index, and total green area index, respectively. The process-based model of the dynamics of leaf area described here is a key element to quantify the value of candidate traits for use in plant breeding and to project the impact of climate change on wheat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>.</p>

OsHAD1, a Haloacid Dehalogenase-Like APase, Enhances Phosphate Accumulation
<p>Phosphorus (P) deficiency limits plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and yield. Since plants can absorb only the in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ic form of P (Pi), a large portion of soil P (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ic and in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ic P complexes) remains unused. Here, we identified and characterized a PHR2-regulated, novel low-Pi-responsive haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-like hydrolase, <i>OsHAD1</i>. While OsHAD1 is a functional HAD protein having both acid phosphatase and phytase activities, it showed little homology with other known low-Pi-responsive HAD superfamily members. Recombinant OsHAD1 is active at acidic pH and dephosphorylates a broad range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ic and in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ic P-containing substrates, including phosphorylated serine and sodium phytate. Exogenous application of recombinant OsHAD1 protein in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> medium supplemented with phytate led to marked increases in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and total P content of Pi-deficient wild-type rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) seedlings. Furthermore, overexpression of <i>OsHAD1</i> in rice resulted in enhanced phosphatase activity, biomass, and total and soluble P contents in Pi-deficient transgenic seedlings treated with phytate as a restricted Pi source. Gene expression and metabolite profiling revealed enhanced Pi starvation responses, such as up-regulation of multiple genes involved in Pi uptake and solubilization, accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ic acids, enhanced secretory phosphatase activity, and depletion of ATP in overexpression lines as compared with the wild type. To elucidate the underlying regulatory mechanisms of OsHAD1, we performed in vitro pull-down assays, which revealed the association of OsHAD1 with protein kinases such as OsNDPKs. We conclude that, besides dephosphorylation of cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ic P, OsHAD1 in coordination with kinases may regulate the phosphorylation status of downstream targets to accomplish Pi homeostasis under limited Pi supply.</p>

UV-B Inhibits Leaf Growth through Changes in Growth Regulating Factors and Gibberellin Levels
<p>Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation affects leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in a wide range of species. In this work, we demonstrate that UV-B levels present in solar radiation inhibit maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> without causing any other visible stress symptoms, including the accumulation of DNA damage. We conducted kinematic analyses of cell division and expansion to understand the impact of UV-B radiation on these cellular processes. Our results demonstrate that the decrease in leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in UV-B-irradiated leaves is a consequence of a reduction in cell production and a shortened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> zone (GZ). To determine the molecular pathways involved in UV-B inhibition of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, we performed RNA sequencing on isolated GZ tissues of control and UV-B-exposed plants. Our results show a link between the observed leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> inhibition and the expression of specific cell cycle and developmental genes, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>-regulating factors (GRFs) and transcripts for proteins participating in different hormone pathways. Interestingly, the decrease in the GZ size correlates with a decrease in the concentration of GA19, the immediate precursor of the active gibberellin, GA1, by UV-B in this zone, which is regulated, at least in part, by the expression of GRF1 and possibly other transcription factors of the GRF family.</p>

Scaling morphogen gradients during tissue growth by a cell division rule
<p>Morphogen gradients guide the patterning of tissues and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s during the development of multicellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>isms. In many cases, morphogen signaling is also required for tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. The consequences of this interplay between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and patterning are not well understood. In the <i>Drosophila</i> wing imaginal disc, the morphogen Dpp guides patterning and is also required for tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. In particular, it was recently reported that cell division in the disc correlates with the temporal increase in Dpp signaling. Here we mathematically model morphogen gradient formation in a growing tissue, accounting also for morphogen advection and dilution. Our analysis defines a new scaling mechanism, which we term the morphogen-dependent division rule (MDDR): when cell division depends on the temporal increase in morphogen signaling, the morphogen gradient scales with the growing tissue size, tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> becomes spatially uniform and the tissue naturally attains a finite size. This model is consistent with many properties of the wing disc. However, we find that the MDDR is not consistent with the phenotype of scaling-defective mutants, supporting the view that temporal increase in Dpp signaling is not the driver of cell division during late phases of disc development. More generally, our results show that local coupling of cell division with morphogen signaling can lead to gradient scaling and uniform <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> even in the absence of global feedbacks. The MDDR scaling mechanism might be particularly beneficial during rapid proliferation, when global feedbacks are hard to implement.</p>

TRPM7 channels mediate spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations in growth plate chondrocytes that promote bone development
<p>During endochondral ossification of long bones, the proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes cause them to be arranged into layered structures constituting the epiphyseal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> plate, where they secrete the cartilage matrix that is subsequently converted into trabecular bone. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling has been implicated in chondrogenesis in vitro. Through fluorometric imaging of bone slices from embryonic mice, we demonstrated that live <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> plate chondrocytes generated small, cell-autonomous Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations that were associated with weak and intermittent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Several genes encoding Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels were expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> plate chondrocytes, but only pharmacological inhibitors of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 7 (TRPM7) reduced the spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations. The TRPM7-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was likely activated downstream of basal phospholipase C activity and was potentiated upon cell hyperpolarization induced by big-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels. Bones from embryos in which <i>Trpm7</i> was conditionally knocked out during ex vivo culture exhibited reduced out<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and displayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">histolog</span></strong>ical abnormalities accompanied by insufficient autophosphorylation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> plate. The link between TRPM7-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations and CaMKII-dependent chondrogenesis was further supported by experiments with chondrocyte-specific <i>Trpm7</i> knockout mice. Thus, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> plate chondrocytes generate spontaneous, TRPM7-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations that promote self-maturation and bone development.</p>

If two deletions don't stop growth, try three
<p>How many and which genes does an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ism need at a minimum to sustain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>? With the identification of essential genes in a variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>isms such as yeast (<i>1</i>), worms (<i>2</i>), and human cultured cells (<i>3</i>–<i>5</i>), the answer may seem obvious: Remove all nonessential genes, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ism should be able to continue to survive and grow. In the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, the workhorse of genetic interaction mapping, ∼1000 of the ∼6000 (∼17%) protein-coding genes are essential for viability (<i>1</i>). So theoretically, one might think that one could remove the other ∼5000 nonessential genes and still have a growing yeast. The reason this does not work is that genes interact with each other to drive different traits, including viability and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. On page 283 of this issue, Kuzmin <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>) provide the first systematic analysis of trigenic interactions in yeast in which three gene deletions are combined in individual strains in order to ascertain the importance of multigene interactions for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>.

<i>Drosophila</i> insulin release is triggered by adipose Stunted ligand to brain Methuselah receptor

The Hydrogen Isotope Composition δ<sup>2</sup>H Reflects Plant Performance
<p>The stable carbon (δ<sup>13</sup>C) and oxygen (δ<sup>18</sup>O) isotope compositions in plant matter reflect photosynthetic and transpirative conditions in plants, respectively. However, the nature of hydrogen isotope composition (δ<sup>2</sup>H) and what it reflects of plant performance is poorly understood. Using durum wheat (<i>Triticum turgidum</i> var <i>durum</i>), this study evaluated the effect of different water and nitrogen growing field conditions on transpiration and how this effect influenced the performance of δ<sup>2</sup>H in autotrophic (flag leaf), mixotrophic (ears), and heterotrophic (grains and roots) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was compared with the δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>18</sup>O in the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s. Isotope compositions were analyzed in dry matter, the water-soluble fraction, and in water from different tissues of a set of genotypes. Similar to δ<sup>13</sup>C, the δ<sup>2</sup>H correlated negatively with stomatal conductance, whereas no correlation was observed for δ<sup>18</sup>O. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was not only affected by changes in transpiration but also by photosynthetic reactions, probably as a consequence of NADPH formation in autotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s. Compared with the δ<sup>2</sup>H of stem water, plant δ<sup>2</sup>H was strongly diminished in photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s such as the flag leaves, whereas it strongly increased in heterotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s such as grains and roots. In heterotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s, δ<sup>2</sup>H was associated with postphotosynthetic effects because there are several processes that lead to <sup>2</sup>H-enrichment of carbohydrates. In summary, δ<sup>2</sup>H exhibited specific features that inform about the water conditions of the wheat crop, together with the photosynthetic characteristics of the plant part considered. Moreover, correlations of δ<sup>2</sup>H with grain yield illustrate that this isotope can be used to assess plant performance under different growing conditions.</p>

RAPTOR Controls Developmental Growth Transitions by Altering the Hormonal and Metabolic Balance
<p>Vegetative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> requires the systemic coordination of numerous cellular processes, which are controlled by regulatory proteins that monitor extracellular and intracellular cues and translate them into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> decisions. In eukaryotes, one of the central factors regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> is the serine/threonine protein kinase Target of Rapamycin (TOR), which forms complexes with regulatory proteins. To understand the function of one such regulatory protein, Regulatory-Associated Protein of TOR 1B (RAPTOR1B), in plants, we analyzed the effect of <i>raptor1b</i> mutations on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and physiology in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) by detailed phenotyping, metabolomic, lipidomic, and proteomic analyses. Mutation of <i>RAPTOR1B</i> resulted in a strong reduction of TOR kinase activity, leading to massive changes in central carbon and nitrogen metabolism, accumulation of excess starch, and induction of autophagy. These shifts led to a significant reduction of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> that occurred nonlinearly during developmental stage transitions. This phenotype was accompanied by changes in cell morphology and tissue anatomy. In contrast to previous studies in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), we found that the Arabidopsis <i>raptor1b</i> mutation did not affect chloroplast development or photosynthetic electron transport efficiency; however, it resulted in decreased CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate and increased stomatal conductance. The <i>raptor1b</i> mutants also had reduced abscisic acid levels. Surprisingly, abscisic acid feeding experiments resulted in partial complementation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> phenotypes, indicating the tight interaction between TOR function and hormone synthesis and signaling in plants.</p>

Auxin Efflux Carrier ZmPGP1 Mediates Root Growth Inhibition under Aluminum Stress
<p>Auxin has been shown to enhance root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> inhibition under aluminum (Al) stress in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), auxin may play a negative role in the Al-induced inhibition of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. In this study, we identified mutants deficient in the maize auxin efflux carrier P-glycoprotein (ZmPGP1) after ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis and used them to elucidate the contribution of ZmPGP1 to Al-induced root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> inhibition. Root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutant, which forms shortened roots and is hyposensitive to auxin, was less inhibited by Al stress than that in the inbred line B73. In the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutants, the root tips displayed higher auxin accumulation and enhanced auxin signaling under Al stress, which was also consistent with the increased expression of auxin-responsive genes. Based on the behavior of the auxin-responsive marker transgene, <i>DR5rev:RFP</i>, we concluded that Al stress reduced the level of auxin in the root tip, which contrasts with the tendency of Al stress-induced Arabidopsis plants to accumulate more auxin in their root tips. In addition, Al stress induced the expression of <i>ZmPGP1</i>. Therefore, in maize, Al stress is associated with reduced auxin accumulation in root tips, a process that is regulated by ZmPGP1 and thus causes inhibition of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. This study provides further evidence about the role of auxin and auxin polar transport in Al-induced root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> regulation in maize.</p>

Converging Light, Energy and Hormonal Signaling Control Meristem Activity, Leaf Initiation, and Growth<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>The development of leaf primordia is subject to light control of meristematic activity. Light regulates the expression of thousands of genes with roles in cell proliferation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> development, and differentiation of photosynthetic cells. Previous work has highlighted roles for hormone homeostasis and the energy-dependent Target of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase in meristematic activity, yet a picture of how these two regulatory mechanisms depend on light perception and interact with each other has yet to emerge. Their relevance beyond leaf initiation also is unclear. Here, we report the discovery that the dark-arrested meristematic region of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) experiences a local energy deprivation state and confirm previous findings that the PIN1 auxin transporter is diffusely localized in the dark. Light triggers a rapid removal of the starvation state and the establishment of PIN1 polar membrane localization consistent with auxin export, both preceding the induction of cell cycle- and cytoplasmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>-associated genes. We demonstrate that shoot meristematic activity can occur in the dark through the manipulation of auxin and cytokinin activity as well as through the activation of energy signaling, both targets of photomorphogenesis action, but the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> developmental outcomes differ: while TOR-dependent energy signals alone stimulate cell proliferation, the development of a normal leaf lamina requires photomorphogenesis-like hormonal responses. We further show that energy signaling adjusts the extent of cell cycle activity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of young leaves non-cellautonomously to available photosynthates and leads to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s constituted of a greater number of cells developing under higher irradiance.

Transcription Factor OsTGA10 Is a Target of the MADS Protein OsMADS8 and Is Required for Tapetum Development

We characterized the function of OsTGA10 using genetic and molecular analyses. <i>OsTGA10</i> was preferentially expressed during stamen development, and mutation of <i>OsTGA10</i> resulted in male sterility. OsTGA10 was required for tapetum development and functioned by interacting with known tapetum genes. In addition, in <i>ostga10</i> stamens, the hallmark cell wall thickening of the endothecium was defective. Our findings suggest that OsTGA10 plays a mediator role between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> identity determination and tapetum development in rice stamen development, between tapetum development and microspore development, and between various regulatory components required for tapetum development. Furthermore, the defective endothecium in <i>ostga10</i> implies that cell wall thickening of endothecium is dependent on tapetum development.</p>

Wild types also were analyzed in various photoperiods and after transfer to free-running light or darkness. Rosette expansion and leaf movement exhibited a circadian oscillation, with superimposed transients after dawn and dusk. Diurnal responses were modified in clock mutants. <i>lhycca1</i> exhibited an inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> at the end of night and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rose earlier after dawn, whereas <i>prr7prr9</i> showed decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> for the first part of the light period. Some features were partly rescued by a matching T-cycle, like the inhibition in <i>lhycca1</i> at the end of the night, indicating that it is due to premature exhaustion of starch. Other features were not rescued, revealing that the clock also regulates expansion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> more directly. Expansion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> was faster at night than in the daytime, whereas published work has shown that the synthesis of cellular components is faster in the day than at nighttime. This temporal uncoupling became larger in short photoperiods and may reflect the differing dependence of expansion and biosynthesis on energy, carbon, and water. While it has been proposed that leaf expansion and movement are causally linked, we did not observe a consistent temporal relationship between expansion and leaf movement.</p>

Dynamic Cytology and Transcriptional Regulation of Rice Lamina Joint Development
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) leaf angle is determined by lamina joint and is an important agricultural trait determining leaf erectness and, hence, the photosynthesis efficiency and grain yield. Genetic studies reveal a complex regulatory network of lamina joint development; however, the morphological changes, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytolog</span></strong>ical transitions, and underlying transcriptional programming remain to be elucidated. A systemic morphological and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytolog</span></strong>ical study reveals a dynamic developmental process and suggests a common but distinct regulation of the lamina joint. Successive and sequential cell division and expansion, cell wall thickening, and programmed cell death at the adaxial or abaxial sides form the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytolog</span></strong>ical basis of the lamina joint, and the increased leaf angle results from the asymmetric cell proliferation and elongation. Analysis of the gene expression profiles at four distinct developmental stages ranging from initiation to senescence showed that genes related to cell division and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, hormone synthesis and signaling, transcription (transcription factors), and protein phosphorylation (protein kinases) exhibit distinct spatiotemporal patterns during lamina joint development. Phytohormones play crucial roles by promoting cell differentiation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> at early stages or regulating the maturation and senescence at later stages, which is consistent with the quantitative analysis of hormones at different stages. Further comparison with the gene expression profile of <i>leaf inclination1</i>, a mutant with decreased auxin and increased leaf angle, indicates the coordinated effects of hormones in regulating lamina joint. These results reveal a dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytolog</span></strong>y of rice lamina joint that is fine-regulated by multiple factors, providing informative clues for illustrating the regulatory mechanisms of leaf angle and plant architecture.</p>

Root Cell-Specific Regulators of Phosphate-Dependent Growth
<p>Cellular specialization in abiotic stress responses is an important regulatory feature driving plant acclimation. Our in silico approach of iterative coexpression, interaction, and enrichment analyses predicted root cell-specific regulators of phosphate starvation response networks in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). This included three uncharacterized genes termed Phosphate starvation-induced gene interacting Root Cell Enriched (<i>PRCE1</i>, <i>PRCE2</i>, and <i>PRCE3</i>). Root cell-specific enrichment of 12 candidates was confirmed in promoter-GFP lines. T-DNA insertion lines of 11 genes showed changes in phosphate status and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> responses to phosphate availability compared with the wild type. Some mutants (<i>cbl1</i>, <i>cipk2</i>, <i>prce3</i>, and <i>wdd1</i>) displayed strong biomass gain irrespective of phosphate supply, while others (<i>cipk14</i>, <i>mfs1</i>, <i>prce1</i>, <i>prce2</i>, and <i>s6k2</i>) were able to sustain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> under low phosphate supply better than the wild type. Notably, root or shoot phosphate accumulation did not strictly correlate with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Mutant response patterns markedly differed from those of master regulators of phosphate homeostasis, <i>PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1</i> (<i>PHR1</i>) and <i>PHOSPHATE2</i> (<i>PHO2</i>), demonstrating that negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> responses in the latter can be overcome when cell-specific regulators are targeted. RNA sequencing analysis highlighted the transcriptomic plasticity in these mutants and revealed PHR1-dependent and -independent regulatory circuits with gene coexpression profiles that were highly correlated to the quantified physiological traits. The results demonstrate how in silico prediction of cell-specific, stress-responsive genes uncovers key regulators and how their manipulation can have positive impacts on plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> under abiotic stress.</p>

EXO70C2 Is a Key Regulatory Factor for Optimal Tip Growth of Pollen
<p>The exocyst, a eukaryotic tethering complex, coregulates targeted exocytosis as an effector of small GTPases in polarized cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. In land plants, several exocyst subunits are encoded by double or triple paralogs, culminating in tens of EXO70 paralogs. Out of 23 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> EXO70 isoforms, we analyzed seven isoforms expressed in pollen. Genetic and microscopic analyses of single mutants in <i>EXO70A2</i>, <i>EXO70C1</i>, <i>EXO70C2</i>, <i>EXO70F1</i>, <i>EXO70H3</i>, <i>EXO70H5</i>, and <i>EXO70H6</i> genes revealed that only a loss-of-function <i>EXO70C2</i> allele resulted in a significant male-specific transmission defect (segregation 40%:51%:9%) due to aberrant pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Mutant pollen tubes grown in vitro exhibited an enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rate and a decreased thickness of the tip cell wall, causing tip bursts. However, <i>exo70C2</i> pollen tubes could frequently recover and restart their speedy elongation, resulting in a repetitive stop-and-go <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> dynamics. A pollen-specific depletion of the closest paralog, <i>EXO70C1</i>, using artificial microRNA in the <i>exo70C2</i> mutant background, resulted in a complete pollen-specific transmission defect, suggesting redundant functions of EXO70C1 and EXO70C2. Both EXO70C1 and EXO70C2, GFP tagged and expressed under the control of their native promoters, localized in the cytoplasm of pollen grains, pollen tubes, and also root trichoblast cells. The expression of EXO70C2-GFP complemented the aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of <i>exo70C2</i> pollen tubes. The absent EXO70C2 interactions with core exocyst subunits in the yeast two-hybrid assay, cytoplasmic localization, and genetic effect suggest an unconventional EXO70 function possibly as a regulator of exocytosis outside the exocyst complex. In conclusion, EXO70C2 is a novel factor contributing to the regulation of optimal tip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of Arabidopsis pollen tubes.</p>

The Microtubule-Associated Protein MAP18 Affects ROP2 GTPase Activity during Root Hair Growth
<p>Establishment and maintenance of the polar site are important for root hair tip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. We previously reported that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN18 (MAP18) functions in controlling the direction of pollen tube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and root hair elongation. Additionally, the Rop GTPase ROP2 was reported as a positive regulator of both root hair initiation and tip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in Arabidopsis. Both loss of function of <i>ROP2</i> and knockdown of <i>MAP18</i> lead to a decrease in root hair length, whereas overexpression of either <i>MAP18</i> or <i>ROP2</i> causes multiple tips or a branching hair phenotype. However, it is unclear whether MAP18 and ROP2 coordinately regulate root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. In this study, we demonstrate that MAP18 and ROP2 interact genetically and functionally. MAP18 interacts physically with ROP2 in vitro and in vivo and preferentially binds to the inactive form of the ROP2 protein. MAP18 promotes ROP2 activity during root hair tip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. Further investigation revealed that MAP18 competes with RhoGTPase GDP DISSOCIATION INHIBITOR1/SUPERCENTIPEDE1 for binding to ROP2, in turn affecting the localization of active ROP2 in the plasma membrane of the root hair tip. These results reveal a novel function of MAP18 in the regulation of ROP2 activation during root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>.</p>

Constitutive Expression of Arabidopsis <i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA19</i> (<i>SAUR19</i>) in Tomato Confers Auxin-Independent Hypocotyl Elongation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA or auxin) mediates the elongation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of shoot tissues by promoting cell expansion. According to the acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> theory proposed in the 1970s, auxin activates plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases (PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases) to facilitate cell expansion by both loosening the cell wall through acidification and promoting solute uptake. Mechanistically, however, this process is poorly understood. Recent findings in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) have demonstrated that auxin-induced <i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA</i> (<i>SAUR</i>) genes promote elongation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and play a key role in PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activation by inhibiting PP2C.D family protein phosphatases. Here, we extend these findings by demonstrating that SAUR proteins also inhibit tomato PP2C.D family phosphatases and that AtSAUR19 overexpression in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) confers the same suite of phenotypes as previously reported for Arabidopsis. Furthermore, we employ a custom image-based method for measuring hypocotyl segment elongation with high resolution and a method for measuring cell wall mechanical properties, to add mechanistic details to the emerging description of auxin-mediated cell expansion. We find that constitutive expression of GFP-AtSAUR19 bypasses the normal requirement of auxin for elongation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> by increasing the mechanical extensibility of excised hypocotyl segments. In contrast, hypocotyl segments overexpressing a PP2C.D phosphatase are specifically impaired in auxin-mediated elongation. The time courses of auxin-induced <i>SAUR</i> expression and auxin-dependent elongation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> were closely correlated. These findings indicate that induction of <i>SAUR</i> expression is sufficient to elicit auxin-mediated expansion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> by activating PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases to facilitate apoplast acidification and mechanical wall loosening.</p>

A Comprehensively Curated Genome-Scale Two-Cell Model for the Heterocystous Cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120
<p><i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 is a nitrogen-fixing filamentous cyanobacterium. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, a fraction of the vegetative cells in each filament terminally differentiate to nongrowing heterocysts. Heterocysts are metabolically and structurally specialized to enable O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive nitrogen fixation. The functionality of the filament, as an association of vegetative cells and heterocysts, is postulated to depend on metabolic exchange of electrons, carbon, and fixed nitrogen. In this study, we compile and evaluate a comprehensive curated stoichiometric model of this two-cell system, with the objective function based on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of the filament under diazotrophic conditions. The predicted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rate under nitrogen-replete and -deplete conditions, as well as the effect of external carbon and nitrogen sources, was thereafter verified. Furthermore, the model was utilized to comprehensively evaluate the optimality of putative metabolic exchange reactions between heterocysts and vegetative cells. The model suggested that optimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> requires at least four exchange metabolites. Several combinations of exchange metabolites resulted in predicted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rates that are higher than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rates achieved by only considering exchange of metabolites previously suggested in the literature. The curated model of the metabolic network of <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 enhances our ability to understand the metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization of multicellular cyanobacteria and provides a platform for further study and engineering of their metabolism.</p>

Photoperiodic control of seasonal growth is mediated by ABA acting on cell-cell communication
<p>In temperate and boreal ecosystems, seasonal cycles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and dormancy allow perennial plants to adapt to winter conditions. We show, in hybrid aspen trees, that photoperiodic regulation of dormancy is mechanistically distinct from autumnal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> cessation. Dormancy sets in when symplastic intercellular communication through plasmodesmata is blocked by a process dependent on the phytohormone abscisic acid. The communication blockage prevents <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>-promoting signals from accessing the meristem. Thus, precocious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> is disallowed during dormancy. The dormant period, which supports robust survival of the aspen tree in winter, is due to loss of access to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>-promoting signals.</p>

The growth pattern of Neandertals, reconstructed from a juvenile skeleton from El Sidrón (Spain)

Furthermore, endocranial features suggest that brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> was not yet completed.

<i>Trichoderma</i> Histone Deacetylase HDA-2 Modulates Multiple Responses in Arabidopsis

In filamentous fungi, chromatin modifications regulate secondary metabolism. In this study we investigated how the absence of histone deacetylase HDA-2 in the <i>Trichoderma atroviride</i> strain Δ<i>hda-2</i> impacts its effect on a host, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The production of VOCs and their impact on plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and development were assessed as well. The Δ<i>hda-2</i> strain was impaired in its ability to colonize Arabidopsis roots, thus affecting the promotion of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and modulation of plant defenses against foliar pathogens <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>, which normally result from interaction with <i>T. atroviride</i>. Furthermore, Δ<i>hda-2</i> VOCs were incapable of triggering plant defenses to counterattack foliar pathogens. The Δ<i>hda-2</i> overproduced the VOC 6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one (6-PP), which resulted in enhanced root branching and differentially regulated phytohormone-related genes. Analysis of ten VOCs (including 6-PP) revealed that three of them positively regulated plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>, whereas six had the opposite effect. Assessment of secondary metabolites, detoxification, and communication with plant-related genes showed a dual role for HDA-2 in <i>T. atroviride</i> gene expression regulation during its interaction with plants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of acetylated histone H3 on the promoters of plant-responsive genes in Δ<i>hda-2</i> showed, in the presence of Arabidopsis, low levels of <i>epl-1</i> and <i>abc-2</i> compared with that in the wild type; whereas <i>ctf-1</i> presented high constitutive levels, supporting a dual role of HDA-2 in gene regulation. This work highlights the importance of HDA-2 as a global regulator in <i>Trichoderma</i> to modulate multiple responses in Arabidopsis.</p>

Genetic Dissection of Fe-Dependent Signaling in Root Developmental Responses to Phosphate Deficiency
<p>The inhibition of primary root (PR) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> is a major developmental response of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) to phosphate (Pi) deficiency. Previous studies have independently uncovered key roles of the LOW PHOSPHATE RESPONSE1 (LPR1) ferroxidase, the tonoplast-localized ALUMINUM SENSITIVE3 (ALS3)/SENSITIVE TO ALUMINUM RHIZOTOXICITY1 (STAR1) transporter complex, and the SENSITIVE TO PROTON RHIZOTOXICITY1 (STOP1; a transcription factor)-ALUMINUM-ACTIVATED MALATE TRANSPORTER1 (ALMT1; a malate transporter) regulatory module in mediating this response by controlling iron (Fe) homeostasis in roots, but how these three components interact to regulate PR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> under Pi deficiency remains unknown. Here, we dissected genetic relationships among these three key components and found that (1) STOP1, ALMT1, and LPR1 act downstream of ALS3/STAR1 in controlling PR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> under Pi deficiency; (2) ALS3/STAR1 inhibits the STOP1-ALMT1 pathway by repressing STOP1 protein accumulation in the nucleus; and (3) STOP1-ALMT1 and LPR1 control PR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> under Pi deficiency in an interdependent manner involving the promotion of malate-dependent Fe accumulation in roots. Furthermore, this malate-mediated Fe accumulation depends on external Pi availability. We also performed a detailed analysis of the dynamic changes in the tissue-specific Fe accumulation patterns in the root tips of plants exposed to Pi deficiency. The results indicate that the degree of inhibition of PR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> induced by Pi deficiency is not linked to the level of Fe accumulated in the root apical meristem or the elongation zone. Our work provides insights into the molecular mechanism that regulates the root developmental response to Pi deficiency.</p>

In particular, the dynamic behavior of cortical MTs is critical for their spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization, yet the molecular mechanisms controlling MT dynamics remain poorly understood. In this study, we used the puzzle piece-shaped pavement cells of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves as a model system in which to study cortical MT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization. We isolated an ethyl methanesulfonate mutant with reduced interdigitation of pavement cells in cotyledons. This line carried a mutation in <i>IQ67 DOMAIN5</i> (<i>IQD5</i>), which encodes a member of the plant-specific IQ motif protein family. Live-cell imaging and biochemical analyses demonstrated that IQD5 binds to MTs and promotes MT assembly. MT-depolymerizing drug treatment and in vivo MT dynamics assays suggested that IQD5 functions to stabilize MTs. Hence, our findings provide genetic, cell biological, and biochemical evidence that IQD5 regulates MT dynamics that affect MT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization and subsequent cell shape formation.</p>

SIAMESE-RELATED1 Is Regulated Posttranslationally and Participates in Repression of Leaf Growth under Moderate Drought
<p>The plant cell cycle is tightly regulated by factors that integrate endogenous cues and environmental signals to adapt plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> to changing conditions. Under drought, cell division in young leaves is blocked by an active mechanism, reducing the evaporative surface and conserving energy resources. The molecular function of cyclin-dependent kinase-inhibitory proteins (CKIs) in regulating the cell cycle has already been well studied, but little is known about their involvement in cell cycle regulation under adverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> conditions. In this study, we show that the transcript of the CKI gene <i>SIAMESE-RELATED1</i> (<i>SMR1</i>) is quickly induced under moderate drought in young Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves. Functional characterization further revealed that SMR1 inhibits cell division and affects meristem activity, thereby restricting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of leaves and roots. Moreover, we demonstrate that SMR1 is a short-lived protein that is degraded by the 26S proteasome after being ubiquitinated by a Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase. Consequently, overexpression of a more stable variant of the SMR1 protein leads to a much stronger phenotype than overexpression of the native SMR1. Under moderate drought, both the <i>SMR1</i> transcript and SMR1 protein accumulate. Despite this induction, <i>smr1</i> mutants do not show overall tolerance to drought stress but do show less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> inhibition of young leaves under drought. Surprisingly, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>-repressive hormone ethylene promotes <i>SMR1</i> induction, but the classical drought hormone abscisic acid does not.</p>

We used <i>chc1</i> alleles and the related <i>chc2</i> mutant as tools to investigate the effects that clathrin defects have on secretion pathways and plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong>. We show that secretion and endocytosis at the plasma membrane are sensitive to CHC1 and CHC2 function in seedling roots and that <i>chc</i> mutants have physiological defects in stomatal function and plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> that have not been described previously. These findings suggest that clathrin supports specific functions in multiple cell types. Stomata movement and gas exchange are altered in <i>chc</i> mutants, indicating that clathrin is important for stomatal regulation. The aberrant function of <i>chc</i> mutant stomata is consistent with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> phenotypes observed under different water and light conditions, which also are similar to those of the secretory SNARE mutant, <i>syp121</i>. The <i>syp121</i> and <i>chc</i> mutants have impaired endocytosis and exocytosis compared with the wild type, indicating a link between SYP121-dependent secretion and clathrin-dependent endocytosis at the plasma membrane. Our findings provide evidence that clathrin and SYP121 functions are important for the coordination of endocytosis and exocytosis and have an impact on stomatal function, gas exchange, and vegetative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

Higher Novel L-Cys Degradation Activity Results in Lower Organic-S and Biomass in <i>Sarcocornia</i> than the Related Saltwort, <i>Salicornia</i>
<p><i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcocornia</i> are almost identical halophytes whose edible succulent shoots hold promise for commercial production in saline water. Enhanced sulfur nutrition may be beneficial to crops naturally grown on high sulfate. However, little is known about sulfate nutrition in halophytes. Here we show that <i>Salicornia europaea</i> (ecotype RN) exhibits a significant increase in biomass and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ic-S accumulation in response to supplemental sulfate, whereas <i>Sarcocornia fruticosa</i> (ecotype VM) does not, instead exhibiting increased sulfate accumulation. We investigated the role of two pathways on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ic-S and biomass accumulation in <i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcoconia</i>: the sulfate reductive pathway that generates Cys and <sc>l</sc>-Cys desulfhydrase that degrades Cys to H<sub>2</sub>S, NH<sub>3</sub>, and pyruvate. The major function of <i>O</i>-acetyl-Ser-(thiol) lyase (OAS-TL; EC 2.5.1.47) is the formation of <sc>l</sc>-Cys, but our study shows that the OAS-TL A and OAS-TL B of both halophytes are enzymes that also degrade <sc>l</sc>-Cys to H<sub>2</sub>S. This activity was significantly higher in <i>Sarcocornia</i> than in <i>Salicornia</i>, especially upon sulfate supplementation. The activity of the sulfate reductive pathway key enzyme, adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate reductase (APR, EC 1.8.99.2), was significantly higher in <i>Salicornia</i> than in <i>Sarcocornia</i>. These results suggest that the low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ic-S level in <i>Sarcocornia</i> is the result of high <sc>l</sc>-Cys degradation rate by OAS-TLs, whereas the greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ic-S and biomass accumulation in <i>Salicornia</i> is the result of higher APR activity and low <sc>l</sc>-Cys degradation rate, resulting in higher net Cys biosynthesis. These results present an initial road map for halophyte growers to attain better <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rates and nutritional value of <i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcocornia</i>.</p>

Root Bending Is Antagonistically Affected by Hypoxia and ERF-Mediated Transcription via Auxin Signaling
<p>When plants encounter soil water logging or flooding, roots are the first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s to be confronted with reduced gas diffusion resulting in limited oxygen supply. Since roots do not generate photosynthetic oxygen, they are rapidly faced with oxygen shortage rendering roots particularly prone to damage. While metabolic adaptations to low oxygen conditions, which ensure basic energy supply, have been well characterized, adaptation of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and development have received less attention. In this study, we show that hypoxic conditions cause the primary root to grow sidewise in a low oxygen environment, possibly to escape soil patches with reduced oxygen availability. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> behavior is reversible in that gravitropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> resumes when seedlings are returned to normoxic conditions. Hypoxic root bending is inhibited by the group VII ethylene response factor (ERFVII) RAP2.12, as <i>rap2.12-1</i> seedlings show exaggerated primary root bending. Furthermore, overexpression of the ERFVII member <i>HRE2</i> inhibits root bending, suggesting that primary root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> direction at hypoxic conditions is antagonistically regulated by hypoxia and hypoxia-activated ERFVIIs. Root bending is preceded by the establishment of an auxin gradient across the root tip as quantified with DII-VENUS and is synergistically enhanced by hypoxia and the auxin transport inhibitor naphthylphthalamic acid. The protein abundance of the auxin efflux carrier PIN2 is reduced at hypoxic conditions, a response that is suppressed by RAP2.12 overexpression, suggesting antagonistic control of auxin flux by hypoxia and ERFVII. Taken together, we show that hypoxia triggers an escape response of the primary root that is controlled by ERFVII activity and mediated by auxin signaling in the root tip.</p>

The REVEILLE Clock Genes Inhibit Growth of Juvenile and Adult Plants by Control of Cell Size
<p>The circadian clock is a complex regulatory network that enhances plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> and fitness in a constantly changing environment. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the clock is composed of numerous regulatory feedback loops in which <i>REVEILLE8</i> (<i>RVE8</i>) and its homologs <i>RVE4</i> and <i>RVE6</i> act in a partially redundant manner to promote clock pace. Here, we report that the remaining members of the <i>RVE8</i> clade, <i>RVE3</i> and <i>RVE5</i>, play only minor roles in the regulation of clock function. However, we find that RVE8 clade proteins have unexpected functions in the modulation of light input to the clock and the control of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> at multiple stages of development. In seedlings, these proteins repress hypocotyl elongation in a daylength- and sucrose-dependent manner. Strikingly, adult <i>rve4 6 8</i> and <i>rve3 4 5 6 8</i> mutants are much larger than wild-type plants, with both increased leaf area and biomass. This size phenotype is associated with a faster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> rate and larger cell size and is not simply due to a delay in the transition to flowering. Gene expression and epistasis analysis reveal that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> phenotypes of <i>rve</i> mutants are due to the misregulation of <i>PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4</i> (<i>PIF4</i>) and <i>PIF5</i> expression. Our results show that even small changes in <i>PIF</i> gene expression caused by the perturbation of clock gene function can have large effects on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">growth</span></strong> of adult plants.</p>
