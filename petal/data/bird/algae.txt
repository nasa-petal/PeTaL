The Plastid Genome of <i>Polytoma uvella</i> Is the Largest Known among Colorless Algae and Plants and Reflects Contrasting Evolutionary Paths to Nonphotosynthetic Lifestyles
<p>The loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s is frequently associated with parasitic or pathogenic lifestyles, but it also can occur in free-living, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-bearing lineages. A common consequence of becoming nonphotosynthetic is the reduction in size and gene content of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> genome. In exceptional circumstances, it can even result in the complete loss of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> DNA (ptDNA) and its associated gene expression system, as reported recently in several lineages, including the nonphotosynthetic green algal genus <i>Polytomella</i>. Closely related to <i>Polytomella</i> is the polyphyletic genus <i>Polytoma</i>, the members of which lost <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s independently of <i>Polytomella</i>. Species from both genera are free-living organisms that contain nonphotosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s, but unlike <i>Polytomella</i>, <i>Polytoma</i> members have retained a genome in their colorless <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>. Here, we present the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> genome of <i>Polytoma uvella</i>: to our knowledge, the first report of ptDNA from a nonphotosynthetic chlamydomonadalean alga. The <i>P. uvella</i> ptDNA contains 25 protein-coding genes, most of which are related to gene expression and none are connected to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s. However, despite its reduced coding capacity, the <i>P. uvella</i> ptDNA is inflated with short repeats and is tens of kilobases larger than the ptDNAs of its closest known photosynthetic relatives, <i>Chlamydomonas leiostraca</i> and <i>Chlamydomonas applanata</i>. In fact, at approximately 230 kb, the ptDNA of <i>P. uvella</i> represents the largest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> genome currently reported from a nonphotosynthetic alga or plant. Overall, the <i>P. uvella</i> and <i>Polytomella</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> genomes reveal two very different evolutionary paths following the loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s: expansion and complete deletion, respectively. We hypothesize that recombination-based DNA-repair mechanisms are at least partially responsible for the different evolutionary outcomes observed in such closely related nonphotosynthetic algae.</p>

Efficient Plastid Transformation in Arabidopsis
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation is routine in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) but 100-fold less frequent in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), preventing its use in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> biology. A recent study revealed that null mutations in <i>ACC2</i>, encoding a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-targeted acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, cause hypersensitivity to spectinomycin. We hypothesized that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation efficiency should increase in the <i>acc2</i> background, because when ACC2 is absent, fatty acid biosynthesis becomes dependent on translation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-encoded ACC β-carboxylase subunit. We bombarded <i>ACC2</i>-defective Arabidopsis leaves with a vector carrying a selectable spectinomycin resistance (<i>aadA</i>) gene and <i>gfp</i>, encoding the green fluorescence protein GFP. Spectinomycin-resistant clones were identified as green cell clusters on a spectinomycin medium. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation was confirmed by GFP accumulation from the second open reading frame of a polycistronic messenger RNA, which would not be translated in the cytoplasm. We obtained one to two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation events per bombarded sample in spectinomycin-hypersensitive Slavice and Columbia <i>acc2</i> knockout backgrounds, an approximately 100-fold enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation frequency. Slavice and Columbia are accessions in which plant regeneration is uncharacterized or difficult to obtain. A practical system for Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation will be obtained by creating an <i>ACC2</i> null background in a regenerable Arabidopsis accession. The recognition that the duplicated ACCase in Arabidopsis is an impediment to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation provides a rational template to implement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation in related recalcitrant crops.</p>

The Non-Mendelian Green Cotyledon Gene in Soybean Encodes a Small Subunit of Photosystem II
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation plays important roles in leaf senescence including regulation of degradation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding proteins. Although most genes encoding enzymes of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation pathway have been identified, the regulation of their activity has not been fully understood. Green cotyledon mutants in legume are stay-green mutants, in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation is impaired during leaf senescence and seed maturation. Among them, the soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) green cotyledon gene <i>cytG</i> is unique because it is maternally inherited. To isolate <i>cytG</i>, we extensively sequenced the soybean chloroplast genome, and detected a 5-bp insertion causing a frame-shift in <i>psbM</i>, which encodes one of the small subunits of photosystem II. Mutant tobacco plants (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) with a disrupted <i>psbM</i> generated using a chloroplast transformation technique had green senescent leaves, confirming that <i>cytG</i> encodes PsbM. The phenotype of <i>cytG</i> was very similar to that of mutant of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l <i>b</i> reductase catalyzing the first step of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l <i>b</i> degradation. In fact, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l <i>b</i>-degrading activity in dark-grown <i>cytG</i> and <i>psbM</i>-knockout seedlings was significantly lower than that of wild-type plants. Our results suggest that PsbM is a unique protein linking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s in presenescent leaves with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation during leaf senescence and seed maturation. Additionally, we discuss the origin of <i>cytG</i>, which may have been selected during domestication of soybean.</p>

Importance of Translocon Subunit Tic56 for rRNA Processing and Chloroplast Ribosome Assembly
<p>Toc159-containing complexes at the outer chloroplast envelope membrane form stable supercomplexes with a 1-MD translocon at the inner chloroplast envelope membrane of which Tic56 is one essential subunit. While the single mutants <i>tic56-1</i> and <i>ppi2</i> (<i>toc159</i>) have an albino phenotype and are able to grow heterotrophically, we find the double mutant to be embryo lethal. Comprehensive quantitative proteome profiling with both single mutants in combination with GeneChip analyses identified a posttranscriptional defect in the accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> ribosomal proteins and diminished expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> encoded proteins. In the <i>tic56-1</i> mutant, the assembly of functional ribosomes is furthermore hampered by a processing defect of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> 23S rRNA. Spectinomycin-treatment of wild-type plants phenocopies the molecular phenotype of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> proteome accumulation in <i>tic56-1</i> and to a smaller degree also <i>ppi2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s, suggesting that a defect in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> translation is largely responsible for the phenotype of both import mutants. Import experiments with the <i>tic56-3</i> mutant revealed no significant defect in the import of small ribosomal protein 16 in the absence of full-length Tic56, suggesting that the defect in ribosome assembly in <i>tic56-1</i> may be independent of a function of Tic56 in protein import. Our data establish a previously unknown link between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> protein import, the processing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> rRNAs, and the assembly of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> ribosomes and provide further knowledge on the function of the translocon components and the molecular basis for their albino phenotype.</p>

Arabidopsis Responds to <i>Alternaria alternata</i> Volatiles by Triggering Plastid Phosphoglucose Isomerase-Independent Mechanisms
<p>Volatile compounds (VCs) emitted by phylogenetically diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microorgan</span></strong>isms (including plant pathogens and microbes that do not normally interact mutualistically with plants) promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, growth, and the accumulation of high levels of starch in leaves through cytokinin (CK)-regulated processes. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants not exposed to VCs, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>ic phosphoglucose isomerase (pPGI) acts as an important determinant of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and growth, likely as a consequence of its involvement in the synthesis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>ic CKs in roots. Moreover, this enzyme plays an important role in connecting the Calvin-Benson cycle with the starch biosynthetic pathway in leaves. To elucidate the mechanisms involved in the responses of plants to microbial VCs and to investigate the extent of pPGI involvement, we characterized pPGI-null <i>pgi1-2</i> Arabidopsis plants cultured in the presence or absence of VCs emitted by <i>Alternaria alternata</i>. We found that volatile emissions from this fungal phytopathogen promote growth, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, and the accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>ic CKs in <i>pgi1-2</i> leaves. Notably, the mesophyll cells of <i>pgi1-2</i> leaves accumulated exceptionally high levels of starch following VC exposure. Proteomic analyses revealed that VCs promote global changes in the expression of proteins involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, starch metabolism, and growth that can account for the observed responses in <i>pgi1-2</i> plants. The overall data show that Arabidopsis plants can respond to VCs emitted by phytopathogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microorgan</span></strong>isms by triggering pPGI-independent mechanisms.</p>

Specialized Plastids Trigger Tissue-Specific Signaling for Systemic Stress Response in Plants
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s comprise a complex set of organelles in plants that can undergo distinctive patterns of differentiation and redifferentiation during their lifespan. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s localized to the epidermis and vascular parenchyma are distinctive in size, structural features, and functions. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s are termed “sensory” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s, and here we show their proteome to be distinct from chloroplasts, with specialized stress-associated features. The distinctive sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> proteome in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) derives from spatiotemporal regulation of nuclear genes encoding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-targeted proteins. Perturbation caused by depletion of the sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-specific protein MutS HOMOLOG1 conditioned local, programmed changes in gene networks controlling chromatin, stress-related phytohormone, and circadian clock behavior and producing a global, systemic stress response in the plant. We posit that the sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> participates in sensing environmental stress, integrating this sensory function with epigenetic and gene expression circuitry to condition heritable stress memory.</p>

Chlorophyll Can Be Reduced in Crop Canopies with Little Penalty to Photosynthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The hypothesis that reducing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l content (Chl) can increase canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s in soybeans was tested using an advanced model of canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s. The relationship among leaf Chl, leaf optical properties, and photosynthetic biochemical capacity was measured in 67 soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) accessions showing large variation in leaf Chl. These relationships were integrated into a biophysical model of canopy-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s to simulate the intercanopy light environment and carbon assimilation capacity of canopies with wild type, a Chl-deficient mutant (<i>Y11y11</i>), and 67 other mutants spanning the extremes of Chl to quantify the impact of variation in leaf-level Chl on canopy-scale photosynthetic assimilation and identify possible opportunities for improving canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s through Chl reduction. These simulations demonstrate that canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s should not increase with Chl reduction due to increases in leaf reflectance and nonoptimal distribution of canopy nitrogen. However, similar rates of canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s can be maintained with a 9% savings in leaf nitrogen resulting from decreased Chl. Additionally, analysis of these simulations indicate that the inability of Chl reductions to increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s arises primarily from the connection between Chl and leaf reflectance and secondarily from the mismatch between the vertical distribution of leaf nitrogen and the light absorption profile. These simulations suggest that future work should explore the possibility of using reduced Chl to improve canopy performance by adapting the distribution of the “saved” nitrogen within the canopy to take greater advantage of the more deeply penetrating light.</p>

Photochemistry beyond the red limit in chlorophyll f–containing photosystems
<p>Photosystems I and II convert solar energy into the chemical energy that powers life. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l a photochemistry, using red light (680 to 700 nm), is near universal and is considered to define the energy “red limit” of oxygenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s.

Charge separation in photosystem I and II uses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l f at 745 nm and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l f (or d) at 727 nm, respectively. Each photosystem has a few even longer-wavelength <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>ls f that collect light and pass excitation energy uphill to the photochemically active pigments.

LIL3, a Light-Harvesting Complex Protein, Links Terpenoid and Tetrapyrrole Biosynthesis in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The LIL3 protein of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) belongs to the light-harvesting complex (LHC) protein family, which also includes the light-harvesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding proteins of photosystems I and II, the early-light-inducible proteins, PsbS involved in nonphotochemical quenching, and the one-helix proteins and their cyanobacterial homologs designated high-light-inducible proteins. Each member of this family is characterized by one or two LHC transmembrane domains (referred to as the LHC motif) to which potential functions such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l binding, protein interaction, and integration of interacting partners into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> membranes have been attributed. Initially, LIL3 was shown to interact with geranylgeranyl reductase (CHLP), an enzyme of terpene biosynthesis that supplies the hydrocarbon chain for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l and tocopherol. Here, we show another function of LIL3 for the stability of proto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>lide oxidoreductase (POR). Multiple protein-protein interaction analyses suggest the direct physical interaction of LIL3 with POR but not with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l synthase. Consistently, LIL3-deficient plants exhibit substantial loss of POR as well as CHLP, which is not due to defective transcription of the POR and CHLP genes but to the posttranslational modification of their protein products. Interestingly, in vitro biochemical analyses provide novel evidence that LIL3 shows high binding affinity to proto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>lide, the substrate of POR. Taken together, this study suggests a critical role for LIL3 in the organization of later steps in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l biosynthesis. We suggest that LIL3 associates with POR and CHLP and thus contributes to the supply of the two metabolites, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>lide and phytyl pyrophosphate, required for the final step in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l <i>a</i> synthesis.</p>

Optimization of Light-Harvesting Pigment Improves Photosynthetic Efficiency
<p>Maximizing light capture by light-harvesting pigment optimization represents an attractive but challenging strategy to improve photosynthetic efficiency. Here, we report that loss of a previously uncharacterized gene, <i>HIGH PHOTOSYNTHETIC EFFICIENCY1</i> (<i>HPE1</i>), optimizes light-harvesting pigments, leading to improved photosynthetic efficiency and biomass production. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>hpe1</i> mutants show faster electron transport and increased contents of carbohydrates. <i>HPE1</i> encodes a chloroplast protein containing an RNA recognition motif that directly associates with and regulates the splicing of target RNAs of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> genes. HPE1 also interacts with other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> RNA-splicing factors, including CAF1 and OTP51, which share common targets with HPE1. Deficiency of HPE1 alters the expression of nucleus-encoded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-related genes, probably through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-to-nucleus signaling, causing decreased total content of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l (<i>a</i>+<i>b</i>) in a limited range but increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l <i>a</i>/<i>b</i> ratio. Interestingly, this adjustment of light-harvesting pigment reduces antenna size, improves light capture, decreases energy loss, mitigates photodamage, and enhances photosynthetic quantum yield during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s. Our findings suggest a novel strategy to optimize light-harvesting pigments that improves photosynthetic efficiency and biomass production in higher plants.</p>

Inhibition of TOR Represses Nutrient Consumption, Which Improves Greening after Extended Periods of Etiolation
<p>Upon illumination, etiolated seedlings experience a transition from heterotrophic to photoautotrophic growth. During this process, the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway provides <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s. This pathway has to be tightly controlled to prevent the accumulation of photoreactive metabolites and to provide stoichiometric amounts of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l for its incorporation into photosynthetic protein complexes. Therefore, plants have evolved regulatory mechanisms to synchronize the biosynthesis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding proteins. Two phytochrome-interacting factors (PIF1 and PIF3) and the DELLA proteins, which are controlled by the gibberellin pathway, are key regulators of this process. Here, we show that impairment of TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) activity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), either by mutation of the TOR complex component <i>RAPTOR1B</i> or by treatment with TOR inhibitors, leads to a significantly reduced accumulation of the photoreactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l precursor proto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>lide in darkness but an increased greening rate of etiolated seedlings after exposure to light. Detailed profiling of metabolic, transcriptomic, and physiological parameters revealed that the TOR-repressed lines not only grow slower, they grow in a nutrient-saving mode, which allows them to resist longer periods of low nutrient availability. Our results also indicated that <i>RAPTOR1B</i> acts upstream of the gibberellin-DELLA pathway and its mutation complements the repressed greening phenotype of <i>pif1</i> and <i>pif3</i> after etiolation.</p>

Light and Plastid Signals Regulate Different Sets of Genes in the Albino Mutant Pap7-1
<p>Plants possessing dysfunctional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s due to defects in pigment biosynthesis or translation are known to repress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s-associated nuclear genes via retrograde signals from the disturbed organelles toward the nucleus. These signals are thought to be essential for proper biogenesis and function of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>. Mutants lacking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-encoded RNA polymerase-associated proteins (PAPs) display a genetic arrest in eoplast-chloroplast transition leading to an albino phenotype in the light. Retrograde signaling in these mutants, therefore, could be expected to be similar as under conditions inducing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> dysfunction. To answer this question, we performed plastome- and genomewide array analyses in the <i>pap7</i>-<i>1</i> mutant of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In parallel, we determined the potential overlap with light-regulated expression networks. To this end, we performed a comparative expression profiling approach using light- and dark-grown wild-type plants as relative control for the expression profiles obtained from light-grown <i>pap7</i>-<i>1</i> mutants. Our data indicate a specific impact of retrograde signals on metabolism-related genes in <i>pap7</i>-<i>1</i> mutants reflecting the starvation situation of the albino seedlings. In contrast, light regulation of PhANGs and other nuclear gene groups appears to be fully functional in this mutant, indicating that a block in chloroplast biogenesis per se does not repress expression of them as suggested by earlier studies. Only genes for light harvesting complex proteins displayed a significant repression indicating an exclusive retrograde impact on this gene family. Our results indicate that chloroplasts and arrested <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s each emit specific signals that control different target gene modules both in positive and negative manner.</p>

A Light Harvesting Complex-Like Protein in Maintenance of Photosynthetic Components in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>
<p>Using a genetic approach, we have identified and characterized a novel protein, named Msf1 (Maintenance factor for photosystem I), that is required for the maintenance of specific components of the photosynthetic apparatus in the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>. Msf1 belongs to the superfamily of light-harvesting complex proteins with three transmembrane domains and consensus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding sites. Loss of Msf1 leads to reduced accumulation of photosystem I and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding proteins/complexes. Msf1is a component of a thylakoid complex containing key enzymes of the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway, thus revealing a possible link between Msf1 and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l biosynthesis. Protein interaction assays and greening experiments demonstrate that Msf1 interacts with Copper target homolog1 (CHL27B) and accumulates concomitantly with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>, implying that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l stabilizes Msf1. Contrary to other light-harvesting complex-like genes, the expression of <i>Msf1</i> is not stimulated by high-light stress, but its protein level increases significantly under heat shock, iron and copper limitation, as well as in stationary cells. Based on these results, we propose that Msf1 is required for the maintenance of photosystem I and specific protein-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l complexes especially under certain stress conditions.</p>

An Organelle RNA Recognition Motif Protein Is Required for Photosystem II Subunit <i>psbF</i> Transcript Editing
<p>Loss-of-function mutations in ORGANELLE RNA RECOGNITION MOTIF PROTEIN6 (ORRM6) result in the near absence of RNA editing of <i>psbF</i>-C77 and the reduction in <i>accD</i>-C794 editing in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The <i>orrm6</i> mutants have decreased levels of photosystem II (PSII) proteins, especially PsbF, lower PSII activity, pale green pigmentation, smaller leaf and plant sizes, and retarded growth. Stable expression of <i>ORRM6</i> rescues the <i>orrm6</i> editing defects and mutant phenotype. Unlike ORRM1, the other known ORRM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> editing factor, ORRM6, does not contain RNA editing interacting protein/multiple organellar RNA editing factor (RIP/MORF) boxes, which are required for ORRM1 to interact with site-specific pentatricopeptide repeat protein editing factors. ORRM6 interacts with RIP1/MORF8, RIP2/MORF2, and RIP9/MORF9, known components of RNA editosomes. While some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> RRM proteins are involved in other forms of RNA processing and translation, the primary function of ORRM6 is evidently to mediate <i>psbF</i>-C77 editing, like the essential site-specific pentatricopeptide repeat protein LOW PSII ACCUMULATION66. Stable expression in the <i>orrm6</i> mutants of a nucleus-encoded, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-targeted PsbF protein from a <i>psbF</i> gene carrying a T at nucleotide 77 significantly increases leaf and plant sizes, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l content, and PSII activity.

As isoprene-emitting species support very high steady-state chloroplastic pool sizes of the primary isoprene substrate, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP), which can mask the effects of oscillatory dynamics on isoprene emission, the size of the DMADP pool was experimentally reduced by either partial inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis pathway by fosmidomycin-feeding or by changes in ambient gas concentrations leading to DMADP pool depletion in intact leaves. In feedback-limited conditions observed at low O<sub>2</sub> and/or high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration under which the rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s is governed by the limited rate of ATP and NADPH formation due to low chloroplastic phosphate levels, oscillations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and isoprene emission were repeatedly induced by rapid environmental modifications in both partly fosmidomycin-inhibited leaves and in intact leaves with in vivo reduced DMADP pools. The oscillations in net assimilation rate and isoprene emission in feedback-inhibited leaves were in the same phase, and relative changes in the pools of photosynthetic metabolites and DMADP estimated by in vivo kinetic methods were directly proportional through all oscillations induced by different environmental perturbations. We conclude that the oscillations in isoprene emission provide direct experimental evidence demonstrating that the response of isoprene emission to changes in ambient gas concentrations is controlled by the chloroplastic reductant supply.</p>

ONE-HELIX PROTEIN2 (OHP2) Is Required for the Stability of OHP1 and Assembly Factor HCF244 and Is Functionally Linked to PSII Biogenesis
<p>The members of the light-harvesting complex protein family, which include the one-helix proteins (OHPs), are characterized by one to four membrane-spanning helices. These proteins function in light absorption and energy dissipation, sensing light intensity, and triggering photomorphogenesis or the binding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l and intermediates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l biosynthesis. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) contains two OHPs, while four homologs (named high-light-induced proteins) exist in <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC6803. Various functions have been assigned to high-light-induced proteins, ranging from photoprotection and the assembly of photosystem I (PSI) and PSII to regulation of the early steps of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l biosynthesis, but little is known about the function of the two plant OHPs. Here, we show that the two Arabidopsis OHPs form heterodimers and that the stromal part of OHP2 interacts with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-localized PSII assembly factor HIGH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>L FLUORESCENCE244 (HCF244). Moreover, concurrent accumulation of the two OHPs and HCF244 is critical for the stability of all three proteins. In particular, the absence of OHP2 leads to the complete loss of OHP1 and HCF244. We used a virus-induced gene silencing approach to minimize the expression of <i>OHP1</i> or <i>OHP2</i> in adult Arabidopsis plants and revealed that OHP2 is essential for the accumulation of the PSII core subunits, while the other photosynthetic complexes and the major light-harvesting complex proteins remained unaffected. We examined the potential functions of the OHP1-OHP2-HCF244 complex in the assembly and/or repair of PSII and propose a role for this heterotrimeric complex in thylakoid membrane biogenesis.</p>

The Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein SOT5/EMB2279 Is Required for Plastid <i>rpl2</i> and <i>trnK</i> Intron Splicing
<p>Chloroplast biogenesis and development are highly complex processes requiring interaction between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> and nuclear genomic products. Using a high-throughput screen for chloroplast biogenesis suppressors in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we identified a <i>suppressor of thf1</i> (<i>sot5</i>) that displays virescent and serrated leaves. Further characterization revealed that <i>sot5</i> mutants are defective in leaf adaxial and abaxial polarity and act as enhancers of <i>asymmetric leaves2</i>. Map-based cloning identified <i>SOT5</i> as a gene previously named <i>EMB2279</i> that encodes a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-targeted pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein with 11 PPR motifs. A G-to-A mutation in <i>sot5</i> leads to a significant decrease in splicing efficiency, generating two additional mRNA variants. As reported previously, the <i>sot5</i> null mutation is embryo lethal. SOT5 is predicted to bind to specific RNA sequences found in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> <i>rpl2</i> and <i>trnK</i> genes, and we found decreased splicing efficiency of the <i>rpl2</i> and <i>trnK</i> genes in <i>sot5</i> mutants. Together, our results reveal that the PPR protein SOT5/EMB2279 is required for intron splicing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> <i>rpl2</i> and <i>trnK</i>, providing insights into the role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> translation in the coupled development between chloroplasts and leaves.</p>

The Ribosome-Bound Protein Pam68 Promotes Insertion of Chlorophyll into the CP47 Subunit of Photosystem II
<p>Photosystem II (PSII) is a large enzyme complex embedded in the thylakoid membrane of oxygenic phototrophs. The biogenesis of PSII requires the assembly of more than 30 subunits, with the assistance of a number of auxiliary proteins. In plants and cyanobacteria, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s-affected mutant 68 (Pam68) is important for PSII assembly. However, its mechanisms of action remain unknown. Using a <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803 strain expressing Flag-tagged Pam68, we purified a large protein complex containing ribosomes, SecY translocase, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding PSII inner antenna CP47. Using 2D gel electrophoresis, we identified a pigmented Pam68-CP47 subcomplex and found Pam68 bound to ribosomes. Our results show that Pam68 binds to ribosomes even in the absence of CP47 translation. Furthermore, Pam68 associates with CP47 at an early phase of its biogenesis and promotes the synthesis of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding polypeptide until the attachment of the small PSII subunit PsbH. Deletion of both Pam68 and PsbH nearly abolishes the synthesis of CP47, which can be restored by enhancing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l biosynthesis. These results strongly suggest that ribosome-bound Pam68 stabilizes membrane segments of CP47 and facilitates the insertion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l molecules into the translated CP47 polypeptide chain.</p>

Plastid Translation Elongation Factor Tu Is Prone to Heat-Induced Aggregation Despite Its Critical Role in Plant Heat Tolerance
<p>Translation elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) is a conserved GTP-binding protein essential for protein translation in prokaryotes and in eukaryotic mitochondria and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s. EF-Tu also has a GTP/GDP-independent chaperone activity that may function in acclimation to heat. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> EF-Tu, Rabe1b, rapidly becomes insoluble at temperatures as low as 35°C in vitro and 41°C in vivo, with more than 90% aggregation after 9 h at 45°C in vivo. Based on its established function in protein translation, heat-induced aggregation likely inactivates Rabe1b. To determine the effect of heat-induced aggregation, we isolated an Arabidopsis <i>rabe1b</i> knockdown mutant and discovered it to be highly compromised in heat tolerance. Overexpression of constitutive GTP- or GDP-bound mutant forms of Rabe1b in Arabidopsis and virus-induced silencing of <i>Rabe1b</i> in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) also reduced heat tolerance. Compromised heat tolerance in the Arabidopsis <i>rabe1b</i> mutant and in the lines overexpressing constitutive GTP- or GDP-bound mutant Rabe1b proteins was associated with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> translation under heat stress. The Arabidopsis <i>rabe1b</i> mutant also showed compromised heat-induced expression of <i>HsfA2</i> and its target genes. Constitutive overexpression of HsfA2 activated its target genes but only partially restored the heat tolerance of the <i>rabe1b</i> mutant. These results strongly suggest that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> protein EF-Tu is heat sensitive and acts as a critical limiting factor in plant heat stress responses, primarily functioning in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> protein translation but also in protein folding and retrograde signaling of nuclear heat-responsive gene expression.</p>

The Impacts of Fluctuating Light on Crop Performance
<p>Rapidly changing light conditions can reduce carbon gain and productivity in field crops because photosynthetic responses to light fluctuations are not instantaneous. Plant responses to fluctuating light occur across levels of organizational complexity from entire canopies to the biochemistry of a single reaction and across orders of magnitude of time. Although light availability and variation at the top of the canopy are largely dependent on the solar angle and degree of cloudiness, lower crop canopies rely more heavily on light in the form of sunflecks, the quantity of which depends mostly on canopy structure but also may be affected by wind. The ability of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s to respond rapidly to these variations in light intensity is restricted by the relatively slow opening/closing of stomata, activation/deactivation of C<sub>3</sub> cycle enzymes, and up-regulation/down-regulation of photoprotective processes. The metabolic complexity of C<sub>4</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s creates the apparently contradictory possibilities that C<sub>4</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s may be both more and less resilient than C<sub>3</sub> to dynamic light regimes, depending on the frequency at which these light fluctuations occur. We review the current understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these limitations to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s in fluctuating light that have shown promise in improving the response times of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s-related processes to changes in light intensity.</p>

The DEAD-box RNA Helicase RH50 Is a 23S-4.5S rRNA Maturation Factor that Functionally Overlaps with the Plastid Signaling Factor GUN1
<p>DEAD-box RNA helicases (DBRHs) modulate RNA secondary structure, allowing RNA molecules to adopt the conformations required for interaction with their target proteins. RH50 is a chloroplast-located DBRH that colocalizes and is coexpressed with GUN1, a central factor in chloroplast-to-nucleus signaling. When combined with mutations that impair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> gene expression (<i>prors1</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>prpl11</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>prps1</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>prps21</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>prps17</i>-<i>1</i>, and <i>prpl24</i>-<i>1</i>), <i>rh50</i> and <i>gun1</i> mutations evoke similar patterns of epistatic effects. These observations, together with the synergistic growth phenotype of the double mutant <i>rh50</i>-<i>1 gun1</i>-<i>102</i>, suggest that RH50 and GUN1 are functionally related and that this function is associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> gene expression, in particular ribosome functioning. However, <i>rh50</i>-<i>1</i> itself is not a gun mutant, although—like <i>gun1</i>-<i>102—</i>the <i>rh50</i>-<i>1</i> mutation suppresses the down-regulation of nuclear genes for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s induced by the <i>prors1</i>-<i>1</i> mutation. The RH50 protein comigrates with ribosomal particles, and is required for efficient translation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> proteins. RH50 binds to transcripts of the 23S-4.5S intergenic region and, in its absence, levels of the corresponding rRNA processing intermediate are strongly increased, implying that RH50 is required for the maturation of the 23S and 4.5S rRNAs. This inference is supported by the finding that loss of RH50 renders chloroplast protein synthesis sensitive to erythromycin and exposure to cold. Based on these results, we conclude that RH50 is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> rRNA maturation factor.</p>

Flavodiiron Proteins Promote Fast and Transient O<sub>2</sub> Photoreduction in <i>Chlamydomonas</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>During oxygenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, the reducing power generated by light energy conversion is mainly used to reduce carbon dioxide. In bacteria and archae, flavodiiron (Flv) proteins catalyze O<sub>2</sub> or NO reduction, thus protecting cells against oxidative or nitrosative stress. These proteins are found in cyanobacteria, mosses, and microalgae, but have been lost in angiosperms. Here, we used <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l fluorescence and oxygen exchange measurement using [<sup>18</sup>O]-labeled O<sub>2</sub> and a membrane inlet mass spectrometer to characterize <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flvB</i> insertion mutants devoid of both FlvB and FlvA proteins. We show that Flv proteins are involved in a photo-dependent electron flow to oxygen, which drives most of the photosynthetic electron flow during the induction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s. As a consequence, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l fluorescence patterns are strongly affected in <i>flvB</i> mutants during a light transient, showing a lower PSII operating yield and a slower nonphotochemical quenching induction. Photoautotrophic growth of <i>flvB</i> mutants was indistinguishable from the wild type under constant light, but severely impaired under fluctuating light due to PSI photo damage. Remarkably, net <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s of <i>flv</i> mutants was higher than in the wild type during the initial hour of a fluctuating light regime, but this advantage vanished under long-term exposure, and turned into PSI photo damage, thus explaining the marked growth retardation observed in these conditions. We conclude that the <i>C. reinhardtii</i> Flv participates in a Mehler-like reduction of O<sub>2</sub>, which drives a large part of the photosynthetic electron flow during a light transient and is thus critical for growth under fluctuating light regimes.</p>

Mechanism of Dual Targeting of the Phytochrome Signaling Component HEMERA/pTAC12 to Plastids and the Nucleus
<p>HEMERA (HMR) is a nuclear and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>ial dual-targeted protein. While it functions in the nucleus as a transcriptional coactivator in phytochrome signaling to regulate a distinct set of light-responsive, growth-relevant genes, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s it is known as pTAC12, which associates with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-encoded RNA polymerase, and is essential for inducing the plastomic photosynthetic genes and initiating chloroplast biogenesis. However, the mechanism of targeting HMR to the nucleus and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s is still poorly understood. Here, we show that HMR can be directly imported into chloroplasts through a transit peptide residing in the N-terminal 50 amino acids. Upon cleavage of the transit peptide and additional proteolytic processing, mature HMR, which begins from Lys-58, retains its biochemical properties in phytochrome signaling. Unexpectedly, expression of mature HMR failed to rescue not only the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>ial but also the nuclear defects of the <i>hmr</i> mutant. This is because the predicted nuclear localization signals of HMR are nonfunctional, and therefore mature HMR is unable to accumulate in either <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s or the nucleus. Surprisingly, fusing the transit peptide of the small subunit of Rubisco with mature HMR rescues both its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>ial and nuclear localization and functions. These results, combined with the observation that the nuclear form of HMR has the same reduced molecular mass as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>ial HMR, support a retrograde protein translocation mechanism in which HMR is targeted first to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s, processed to the mature form, and then relocated to the nucleus.</p>

Ubiquitin-Proteasome Dependent Regulation of the GOLDEN2-LIKE 1 Transcription Factor in Response to Plastid Signals
<p>Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) GOLDEN2-LIKE (GLK) transcription factors promote chloroplast biogenesis by regulating the expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s-related genes. Arabidopsis GLK1 is also known to participate in retrograde signaling from chloroplasts to the nucleus. To elucidate the mechanism by which GLK1 is regulated in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> signals, we biochemically characterized Arabidopsis GLK1 protein. Expression analysis of GLK1 protein indicated that GLK1 accumulates in aerial tissues. Both tissue-specific and Suc-dependent accumulation of GLK1 were regulated primarily at the transcriptional level. In contrast, norflurazon- or lincomycin-treated <i>gun1</i>-<i>101</i> mutant expressing normal levels of <i>GLK1</i> mRNA failed to accumulate GLK1 protein, suggesting that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> signals directly regulate the accumulation of GLK1 protein in a GUN1-independent manner. Treatment of the <i>glk1glk2</i> mutant expressing functional GFP-GLK1 with a proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, induced the accumulation of polyubiquitinated GFP-GLK1. Furthermore, the level of endogenous GLK1 in plants with damaged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s was partially restored when those plants were treated with MG-132. Collectively, these data indicate that the ubiquitin-proteasome system participates in the degradation of Arabidopsis GLK1 in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> signals.</p>

A Single Arabidopsis Gene Encodes Two Differentially Targeted Geranylgeranyl Diphosphate Synthase Isoforms
<p>A wide diversity of isoprenoids is produced in different plant compartments. Most groups of isoprenoids synthesized in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s, and some produced elsewhere in the plant cell derive from geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) synthesized by GGPP synthase (GGPPS) enzymes. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), five genes appear to encode GGPPS isoforms localized in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s (two), the endoplasmic reticulum (two), and mitochondria (one). However, the loss of function of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-targeted GGPPS11 isoform (referred to as G11) is sufficient to cause lethality. Here, we show that the absence of a strong transcription initiation site in the <i>G11</i> gene results in the production of transcripts of different lengths. The longer transcripts encode an isoform with a functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> import sequence that produces GGPP for the major groups of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>ial isoprenoids. However, shorter transcripts are also produced that lack the first translation initiation codon and rely on a second in-frame ATG codon to produce an enzymatically active isoform lacking this N-terminal domain. This short enzyme localizes in the cytosol and is essential for embryo development. Our results confirm that the production of differentially targeted enzyme isoforms from the same gene is a central mechanism to control the biosynthesis of isoprenoid precursors in different plant cell compartments.</p>

Mesophyll Abscisic Acid Restrains Early Growth and Flowering But Does Not Directly Suppress Photosynthesis
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) levels increase significantly in plants under stress conditions, and ABA is thought to serve as a key stress-response regulator. However, the direct effect of ABA on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and the effect of mesophyll ABA on yield under both well-watered and drought conditions are still the subject of debate. Here, we examined this issue using transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants carrying a dominant ABA-signaling inhibitor under the control of a mesophyll-specific promoter (<i>FBPase::abi1-1</i>, abbreviated to <i>fa</i>). Under normal conditions, <i>fa</i> plants displayed slightly higher stomatal conductance and carbon assimilation than wild-type plants; however, these parameters were comparable following ABA treatment. These observations suggest that ABA does not directly inhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s in the short term. The <i>fa</i> plants also exhibited a variety of altered phenotypes under optimal conditions, including more vigorous initial growth, earlier flowering, smaller flowers, and delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation. Furthermore, under optimal conditions, <i>fa</i> plant seed production was less than a third of that observed for the wild type. However, under drought conditions, wild-type and <i>fa</i> seed yields were similar due to a significant reduction in wild-type seed and no reduction in <i>fa</i> seed. These findings suggest that endogenous basal ABA inhibits a stress-escape response under nonstressed conditions, allowing plants to accumulate biomass and maximize yield. The lack of a correlation between flowering time and plant biomass combined with delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation suggests that this stress-escape behavior is regulated independently and upstream of other ABA-induced effects such as rapid growth and flowering.</p>

SEED CAROTENOID DEFICIENT Functions in Isoprenoid Biosynthesis via the Plastid MEP Pathway

Here, we identified and characterized <i>SEED CAROTENOID DEFICIENT</i> (<i>SCD</i>), which encodes an enzyme that functions in the biosynthesis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> isoprenoids in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). SCD converts 2<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erytrithol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate to 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate in the penultimate step of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. In <i>scd</i> mutants, plant growth and development are impaired and the levels of MEP-derived isoprenoids, such as carotenoids, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>ls, and tocopherols, as well as abscisic and gibberellic acids, are reduced in leaves and seeds. This <i>scd</i> metabolic alteration varies among plant tissues and under different light conditions. RNA-sequencing of the <i>scd</i> mutant and wild type identified a limited number of differentially expressed genes in the MEP pathway, although isoprenoid levels were significantly reduced in <i>scd</i> seeds and dark-grown leaves. Furthermore, <i>SCD</i>-overexpressing transgenic lines showed little or no differences in isoprenoid levels, indicating that SCD may be subject to posttranslational regulation or not represent a rate-limiting step in the MEP pathway. These results enhance our understanding of the transcriptomic and metabolic regulatory roles of enzymes in the MEP pathway and of their effects on downstream isoprenoid pathways in various plant tissues and under different light conditions.</p>

Chloroplast Accumulation Response Enhances Leaf Photosynthesis and Plant Biomass Production
<p>Under high light intensity, chloroplasts avoid absorbing excess light by moving to anticlinal cell walls (avoidance response), but under low light intensity, chloroplasts accumulate along periclinal cell walls (accumulation response). In most plant species, these responses are induced by blue light and are mediated by the blue light photoreceptor, phototropin, which also regulates phototropism, leaf flattening, and stomatal opening. These phototropin-mediated responses could enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and biomass production. Here, using various Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants deficient in chloroplast movement, we demonstrated that the accumulation response enhances leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and plant biomass production. Conspicuously, <i>phototropin2</i> mutant plants specifically defective in the avoidance response but not in other phototropin-mediated responses displayed a constitutive accumulation response irrespective of light intensities, enhanced leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, and increased plant biomass production. Therefore, our findings provide clear experimental evidence of the importance of the chloroplast accumulation response in leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and biomass production.</p>

Although the interaction between H<sub>2</sub> production and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation has been studied extensively, their interplay with O<sub>2</sub> produced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s has not been considered. By simultaneously measuring gas exchange and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l fluorescence, we identified an O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction mechanism that functions during anaerobic dark-to-light transitions and demonstrate that flavodiiron proteins (Flvs) are the major players involved in light-dependent O<sub>2</sub> uptake. We further show that Flv-mediated O<sub>2</sub> uptake is critical for the rapid induction of CO<sub>2</sub> fixation but is not involved in the creation of the micro-oxic niches proposed previously to protect the [FeFe]-hydrogenase from O<sub>2</sub>. By studying a mutant lacking both hydrogenases (HYDA1 and HYDA2) and both Flvs (FLVA and FLVB), we show that the induction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s is strongly delayed in the absence of both sets of proteins. Based on these data, we propose that Flvs are involved in an important intracellular O<sub>2</sub> recycling process, which acts as a relay between H<sub>2</sub> production and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation.</p>

Molecular Mechanisms Preventing Senescence in Response to Prolonged Darkness in a Desiccation-Tolerant Plant
<p>The desiccation-tolerant plant <i>Haberlea rhodopensis</i> can withstand months of darkness without any visible senescence. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of this adaptation to prolonged (30 d) darkness and subsequent return to light. <i>H. rhodopensis</i> plants remained green and viable throughout the dark treatment. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that darkness regulated several transcription factor (TF) genes. Stress- and autophagy-related TFs such as <i>ERF8</i>, <i>HSFA2b</i>, <i>RD26</i>, <i>TGA1</i>, and <i>WRKY33</i> were up-regulated, while chloroplast- and flowering-related TFs such as <i>ATH1</i>, <i>COL2</i>, <i>COL4</i>, <i>RL1</i>, and <i>PTAC7</i> were repressed. <i>PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4</i>, a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis and promoter of senescence, also was down-regulated. In response to darkness, most of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s- and photorespiratory-related genes were strongly down-regulated, while genes related to autophagy were up-regulated. This occurred concomitant with the induction of SUCROSE NON-FERMENTING1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASES (SnRK1) signaling pathway genes, which regulate responses to stress-induced starvation and autophagy. Most of the genes associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l catabolism, which are induced by darkness in dark-senescing species, were either unregulated (<i>PHEOPHORBIDE A OXYGENASE, PAO; RED <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>L CATABOLITE REDUCTASE, RCCR</i>) or repressed (<i>STAY GREEN-LIKE</i>, <i>PHEOPHYTINASE</i>, and <i>NON-YELLOW COLORING1</i>). Metabolite profiling revealed increases in the levels of many amino acids in darkness, suggesting increased protein degradation. In darkness, levels of the chloroplastic lipids digalactosyldiacylglycerol, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol decreased, while those of storage triacylglycerols increased, suggesting degradation of chloroplast membrane lipids and their conversion to triacylglycerols for use as energy and carbon sources. Collectively, these data show a coordinated response to darkness, including repression of photosynthetic, photorespiratory, flowering, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l catabolic genes, induction of autophagy and SnRK1 pathways, and metabolic reconfigurations that enable survival under prolonged darkness.</p>

Evidence That Isoprene Emission Is Not Limited by Cytosolic Metabolites. Exogenous Malate Does Not Invert the Reverse Sensitivity of Isoprene Emission to High [CO<sub>2</sub>]
<p>Isoprene is synthesized via the chloroplastic 2-<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-xylulose 5-phosphate pathway (MEP/DOXP), and its synthesis is directly related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, except under high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, when the rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s increases but isoprene emission decreases. Suppression of MEP/DOXP pathway activity by high CO<sub>2</sub> has been explained either by limited supply of the cytosolic substrate precursor, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate (PEP), into chloroplast as the result of enhanced activity of cytosolic PEP carboxylase or by limited supply of energetic and reductive equivalents. We tested the PEP-limitation hypotheses by feeding leaves with the PEP carboxylase competitive inhibitors malate and diethyl oxalacetate (DOA) in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>). Malate feeding resulted in the inhibition of net assimilation, photosynthetic electron transport, and isoprene emission rates, but DOA feeding did not affect any of these processes except at very high application concentrations. Both malate and DOA did not alter the sensitivity of isoprene emission to high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Malate inhibition of isoprene emission was associated with enhanced chloroplastic reductive status that suppressed light reactions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, ultimately leading to reduced isoprene substrate dimethylallyl diphosphate pool size. Additional experiments with altered oxygen concentrations in conditions of feedback-limited and non-feedback-limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s further indicated that changes in isoprene emission rate in control and malate-inhibited leaves were associated with changes in the share of ATP and reductive equivalent supply for isoprene synthesis. The results of this study collectively indicate that malate importantly controls the chloroplast reductive status and, thereby, affects isoprene emission, but they do not support the hypothesis that cytosolic metabolite availability alters the response of isoprene emission to changes in atmospheric composition.</p>

Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l fluorescence measurements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in optically dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to scattering and absorption. Consequently, externally measured effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how measured distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally measured quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one side of thallus cross sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with laser light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l fluorescence from cross sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based variable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l fluorescence measurements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l fluorescence profiles in combination with integrating sphere measurements of reflectance and transmittance to calculate depth-resolved photon absorption profiles, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to photons absorbed by PSII. Absorption profiles of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically observed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing photon absorption via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

Temperature-Induced Remodeling of the Photosynthetic Machinery Tunes Photosynthesis in the Thermophilic Alga <i>Cyanidioschyzon merolae</i>
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thermophil</span></strong>ic alga <i>C. merolae</i> thrives in extreme environments (low pH and temperature between 40°C and 56°C). In this study, we investigated the acclimation process of the alga to a colder temperature (25°C). A long-term cell growth experiment revealed an extensive remodeling of the photosynthetic apparatus in the first 250 h of acclimation, which was followed by cell growth to an even higher density than the control (grown at 42°C) cell density. Once the cells were shifted to the lower temperature, the proteins of the light-harvesting antenna were greatly down-regulated and the phycobilisome composition was altered. The amount of PSI and PSII subunits was also decreased, but the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l to photosystems ratio remained unchanged. The 25°C cells possessed a less efficient photon-to-oxygen conversion rate and require a 2.5 times higher light intensity to reach maximum photosynthetic efficiency. With respect to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l, however, the photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate of the 25°C culture was 2 times higher than the control. Quantitative proteomics revealed that acclimation requires, besides remodeling of the photosynthetic apparatus, also adjustment of the machinery for protein folding, degradation, and homeostasis. In summary, these remodeling processes tuned <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s according to the demands placed on the system and revealed the capability of <i>C. merolae</i> to grow under a broad range of temperatures.</p>

The Liverwort, <i>Marchantia</i>, Drives Alternative Electron Flow Using a Flavodiiron Protein to Protect PSI
<p>The diffusion efficiency of oxygen in the atmosphere, like that of CO<sub>2</sub>, is approximately 10<sup>4</sup> times greater than that in aqueous environments. Consequently, terrestrial photosynthetic organisms need mechanisms to protect against potential oxidative damage. The liverwort <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>, a basal land plant, has habitats where it is exposed to both water and the atmosphere. Furthermore, like cyanobacteria, <i>M. polymorpha</i> has genes encoding flavodiiron proteins (FLV). In cyanobacteria, FLVs mediate oxygen-dependent alternative electron flow (AEF) to suppress the production of reactive oxygen species. Here, we investigated whether FLVs are required for the protection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s in <i>M. polymorpha</i>. A mutant deficient in the FLV1 isozyme (Δ<i>MpFlv1</i>) sustained photooxidative damage to photosystem I (PSI) following repetitive short-saturation pulses of light. Compared with the wild type (Takaragaike-1), Δ<i>MpFlv1</i> showed the same photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate but a lower electron transport rate during the induction phase of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s. Additionally, the reaction center <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l in PSI, P700, was highly reduced in Δ<i>MpFlv1</i> but not in Takaragaike-1. These results indicate that the gene product of <i>MpFlv1</i> drives AEF to oxidize PSI, as in cyanobacteria. Furthermore, FLV-mediated AEF supports the production of a proton motive force to possibly induce the nonphotochemical quenching of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l fluorescence and suppress electron transport in the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub>/<i>f</i> complex. After submerging the thalli, a decrease in photosystem II operating efficiency was observed, particularly in Δ<i>MpFlv1</i>, which implies that species living in these sorts of habitats require FLV-mediated AEF.</p>

Leaf Amino Acid Supply Affects Photosynthetic and Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Nitrogen Stress
<p>The coordinated distribution of nitrogen to source leaves and sinks is essential for supporting leaf metabolism while also supplying sufficient nitrogen to seeds for development. This study aimed to understand how regulated amino acid allocation to leaves affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and overall plant nitrogen use efficiency in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and how soil nitrogen availability influences these processes. Arabidopsis plants with a knockout of <i>AAP2</i>, encoding an amino acid permease involved in xylem-to-phloem transfer of root-derived amino acids, were grown in low-, moderate-, and high-nitrogen environments. We analyzed nitrogen allocation to shoot tissues, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, and photosynthetic and plant nitrogen use efficiency in these knockout plants. Our results demonstrate that, independent of nitrogen conditions, <i>aap2</i> plants allocate more nitrogen to leaves than wild-type plants. Increased leaf nitrogen supply positively affected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l and Rubisco levels, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, and carbon assimilation and transport to sinks. The <i>aap2</i> plants outperformed wild-type plants with respect to growth, seed yield and carbon storage pools, and nitrogen use efficiency in both high and deficient nitrogen environments. Overall, this study demonstrates that increasing nitrogen allocation to leaves represents an effective strategy for improving carbon fixation and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. The results indicate that an optimized coordination of nitrogen and carbon partitioning processes is critical for high oilseed production in Arabidopsis, including in plants exposed to limiting nitrogen conditions.</p>

Vacuolar Iron Stores Gated by NRAMP3 and NRAMP4 Are the Primary Source of Iron in Germinating Seeds
<p>During seed germination, iron (Fe) stored in vacuoles is exported by the redundant NRAMP3 and NRAMP4 transporter proteins. A double <i>nramp3 nramp4</i> mutant is unable to mobilize Fe stores and does not develop in the absence of external Fe. We used RNA sequencing to compare gene expression in <i>nramp3 nramp4</i> and wild type during germination and early seedling development. Even though sufficient Fe was supplied, the Fe-responsive transcription factors <i>bHLH38</i>, <i>39</i>, <i>100</i>, and <i>101</i> and their downstream targets <i>FRO2</i> and <i>IRT1</i> mediating Fe uptake were strongly upregulated in the <i>nramp3 nramp4</i> mutant. Activation of the Fe deficiency response was confirmed by increased ferric chelate reductase activity in the mutant. At early stages, genes important for chloroplast redox control (<i>FSD1</i> and <i>SAPX</i>), Fe homeostasis (<i>FER1</i> and <i>SUFB</i>), and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l metabolism (<i>HEMA1</i> and <i>NYC1</i>) were downregulated, indicating limited Fe availability in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s. In contrast, expression of <i>FRO3</i>, encoding a ferric reductase involved in Fe import into the mitochondria, was maintained, and Fe-dependent enzymes in the mitochondria were unaffected in <i>nramp3 nramp4</i>. Together, these data show that a failure to mobilize Fe stores during germination triggered Fe deficiency responses and strongly affected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s, but not mitochondria.</p>

Carbonic Anhydrase Mutants in <i>Zea mays</i> Have Altered Stomatal Responses to Environmental Signals
<p>Stomata regulate transpirational water loss and CO<sub>2</sub> uptake for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s in response to changing environmental conditions. Research investigating stomatal movement has mostly been conducted in C<sub>3</sub> eudicot species, which have very different CO<sub>2</sub> requirements for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s relative to C<sub>4</sub> grasses. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) catalyzes the hydration of CO<sub>2</sub>, and its activity has been linked to stomatal aperture regulation in eudicots. The number of <i>Ca</i> genes and their evolutionary history differ between monocots and dicots, and many questions remain unanswered about potential neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization of grass <i>Ca</i> paralogs and their roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and stomatal conductance. To investigate the roles of different <i>Ca</i> genes in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), we examined stomatal responses in <i>ca1</i> and <i>ca2</i> single mutants as well as a <i>ca1ca2</i> double mutant. The <i>ca1</i> and <i>ca2</i> single mutants had 10% and 87% of the CA activity exhibited by the wild type, respectively, while <i>ca1ca2</i> had less than 5% of wild-type CA activity. The <i>ca</i> mutants had higher stomatal conductance than the wild type and slower stomatal closure in response to increases in CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure. Contrary to previous reports in eudicots, <i>ca</i> mutants showed slowed stomatal closure in response to the light-dark transition and did not show differences in stomatal density compared with the wild type. These results implicate CA-mediated signaling in the control of stomatal movement but not stomatal development. Drought experiments with <i>ca1ca2</i> mutant plants suggest a role for CA in water-use efficiency and reveal that <i>Z. mays</i> is not optimized for water-use efficiency under well-watered conditions.</p>

A Specific Glycogen Mobilization Strategy Enables Rapid Awakening of Dormant Cyanobacteria from Chlorosis
<p>Many organisms survive stressful conditions via entry into a dormant state that can be rapidly exited when the stressor disappears; this ability provides a strong selective advantage. In the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803, the exit from nitrogen chlorosis takes less than 48 h and is enabled by the impressive metabolic flexibility of these cyanobacteria, which pass through heterotrophic and mixotrophic phases before reentering photoautotrophic growth. Switching between these states requires delicate coordination of carbohydrate oxidation, CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s. Here, we investigated the contribution of the different carbon catabolic routes by assessing mutants of these pathways during nitrogen chlorosis and resuscitation. The addition of nitrate to nitrogen-starved cells rapidly starts the awakening program. Metabolism switches from maintenance metabolism, characterized by residual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and low cellular ATP levels, to an initial heterotrophic phase, characterized by respiration and an immediate increase in ATP levels. This respiration relies on glycogen breakdown catalyzed by the glycogen phosphorylase GlgP2. In the following transient mixotrophic phase, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation restart and glycogen is consumed. During the mixotrophic phase, parallel operation of the oxidative pentose phosphate cycle and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway is required for resuscitation to proceed; the glycolytic route via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway has minor importance. Our data suggest that, during resuscitation, only the Entner-Doudoroff and oxidative pentose phosphate pathways supply the metabolic intermediates necessary for the anabolic reactions required to reconstitute a vegetative cell. Intriguingly, the key enzymes for glycogen catabolism are already expressed during the preceding chlorotic phase, in apparent preparation for rapid resuscitation.</p>

Natural Variation within a Species for Traits Underpinning C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis
<p>Engineering C<sub>4</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s into C<sub>3</sub> crops could substantially increase their yield by alleviating photorespiratory losses. This objective is challenging because the C<sub>4</sub> pathway involves complex modifications to the biochemistry, cell biology, and anatomy of leaves. Forward genetics has provided limited insight into the mechanistic basis of these properties, and there have been no reports of significant quantitative intraspecific variation of C<sub>4</sub> attributes that would allow trait mapping. Here, we show that accessions of the C<sub>4</sub> species <i>Gynandropsis gynandra</i> collected from locations across Africa and Asia exhibit natural variation in key characteristics of C<sub>4</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s. Variable traits include bundle sheath size and vein density, gas-exchange parameters, and carbon isotope discrimination associated with the C<sub>4</sub> state. The abundance of transcripts encoding core enzymes of the C<sub>4</sub> cycle also showed significant variation. Traits relating to water use showed more quantitative variation than those associated with carbon assimilation. We propose that variation in these traits likely adapted the hydraulic system for increased water use efficiency rather than improving carbon fixation, indicating that selection pressure may drive C<sub>4</sub> diversity in <i>G. gynandra</i> by modifying water use rather than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s. The accessions analyzed can be easily crossed and produce fertile offspring. Our findings, therefore, indicate that natural variation within this C<sub>4</sub> species is sufficiently large to allow genetic mapping of key C<sub>4</sub> traits and regulators.</p>

Measurement of Gross Photosynthesis, Respiration in the Light, and Mesophyll Conductance Using H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O Labeling
<p>A fundamental challenge in plant physiology is independently determining the rates of gross O<sub>2</sub> production by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and O<sub>2</sub> consumption by respiration, photorespiration, and other processes. Previous studies on isolated chloroplasts or leaves have separately constrained net and gross O<sub>2</sub> production (NOP and GOP, respectively) by labeling ambient O<sub>2</sub> with <sup>18</sup>O while leaf water was unlabeled. Here, we describe a method to accurately measure GOP and NOP of whole detached leaves in a cuvette as a routine gas-exchange measurement. The petiole is immersed in water enriched to a δ<sup>18</sup>O of ∼9,000‰, and leaf water is labeled through the transpiration stream. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s transfers <sup>18</sup>O from H<sub>2</sub>O to O<sub>2</sub>. GOP is calculated from the increase in δ<sup>18</sup>O of O<sub>2</sub> as air passes through the cuvette. NOP is determined from the increase in O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>. Both terms are measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation and other standard gas-exchange parameters also were measured. Reproducible measurements are made on a single leaf for more than 15 h. We used this method to measure the light response curve of NOP and GOP in French bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) at 21% and 2% O<sub>2</sub>. We then used these data to examine the O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> ratio of net <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, the light response curve of mesophyll conductance, and the apparent inhibition of respiration in the light (Kok effect) at both oxygen levels.

Leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l fluorescence and the composition of thylakoid membrane proteins revealed that <i>ohp1</i> deletion substantially affected photosystem II (PSII) core protein function and led to reduced levels of photosystem I core proteins; however, it did not affect LHC accumulation. Transgenic <i>ohp1</i> plants rescued with OHP1-HA or OHP1-Myc proteins developed a normal phenotype. Using these tagged OHP1 proteins in transgenic plants, we localized OHP1 to thylakoid membranes, where it formed protein complexes with both OHP2 and High <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l Fluorescence244 (HCF244). We also found PSII core proteins D1/D2, HCF136, and HCF173 and a few other plant-specific proteins associated with the OHP1/OHP2-HCF244 complex, suggesting that these complexes are early intermediates in PSII assembly. OHP1 interacted directly with HCF244 in the complex. Therefore, OHP1 and HCF244 play important roles in the stable accumulation of PSII.</p>

Natural Variation Underlies Differences in ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR17 Activity in Fruit Peel Degreening

Such developmental changes in color are associated with the biosynthesis of pigments as well as with degreening through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation. Here, we demonstrated that natural variation in the coding region of the gene <i>ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR17</i> (<i>ERF17</i>) contributes to apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>) fruit peel degreening. Specifically, <i>ERF17</i> mutant alleles with different serine (Ser) repeat insertions in the coding region exhibited enhanced transcriptional regulation activity in a dual-luciferase reporter assay when more Ser repeats were present. Notably, surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that the number of Ser repeats affected the binding activity of ERF17 to the promoter sequences of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation-related genes. In addition, overexpression of <i>ERF17</i> in evergreen apples altered the accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l. Furthermore, we demonstrated that <i>ERF17</i> has been under selection since the origin of apple tree cultivation.

Suboptimal Acclimation of Photosynthesis to Light in Wheat Canopies<sup>[CC-BY]</sup>
<p>Photosynthetic acclimation (photoacclimation) is the process whereby leaves alter their morphology and/or biochemistry to optimize photosynthetic efficiency and productivity according to long-term changes in the light environment. The three-dimensional architecture of plant canopies imposes complex light dynamics, but the drivers for photoacclimation in such fluctuating environments are poorly understood. A technique for high-resolution three-dimensional reconstruction was combined with ray tracing to simulate a daily time course of radiation profiles for architecturally contrasting field-grown wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) canopies. An empirical model of photoacclimation was adapted to predict the optimal distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s according to the fluctuating light patterns throughout the canopies. While the photoacclimation model output showed good correlation with field-measured gas-exchange data at the top of the canopy, it predicted a lower optimal light-saturated rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s at the base. Leaf Rubisco and protein contents were consistent with the measured optimal light-saturated rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s. We conclude that, although the photosynthetic capacity of leaves is high enough to exploit brief periods of high light within the canopy (particularly toward the base), the frequency and duration of such sunflecks are too small to make acclimation a viable strategy in terms of carbon gain. This suboptimal acclimation renders a large portion of residual photosynthetic capacity unused and reduces photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency at the canopy level, with further implications for photosynthetic productivity. It is argued that (1) this represents an untapped source of photosynthetic potential and (2) canopy nitrogen could be lowered with no detriment to carbon gain or grain protein content.</p>

Establishment of Photosynthesis through Chloroplast Development Is Controlled by Two Distinct Regulatory Phases
<p>Chloroplasts develop from undifferentiated pro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s present in meristematic tissue. Thus, chloroplast biogenesis is closely connected to leaf development, which restricts our ability to study the process of chloroplast biogenesis per se. As a consequence, we know relatively little about the regulatory mechanisms behind the establishment of the photosynthetic reactions and how the activities of the two genomes involved are coordinated during chloroplast development. We developed a single cell-based experimental system from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with high temporal resolution allowing for investigations of the transition from pro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s to functional chloroplasts. Using this unique cell line, we could show that the establishment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s is dependent on a regulatory mechanism involving two distinct phases. The first phase is triggered by rapid light-induced changes in gene expression and the metabolome. The second phase is dependent on the activation of the chloroplast and generates massive changes in the nuclear gene expression required for the transition to photosynthetically functional chloroplasts. The second phase also is associated with a spatial transition of the chloroplasts from clusters around the nucleus to the final position at the cell cortex. Thus, the establishment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s is a two-phase process with a clear checkpoint associated with the second regulatory phase allowing coordination of the activities of the nuclear and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> genomes.</p>

Nitric Oxide Mediates Nitrite-Sensing and Acclimation and Triggers a Remodeling of Lipids
<p>Nitric oxide (NO) is an intermediate of the nitrogen cycle, an industrial pollutant, and a marker of climate change. NO also acts as a gaseous transmitter in a variety of biological processes. The impact of environmental NO needs to be addressed. In diatoms, a dominant phylum in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phyto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plankton</span></strong></span></strong>, NO was reported to mediate programmed cell death in response to diatom-derived polyunsaturated aldehydes. Here, using the <i>Phaeodactylum</i> Pt1 strain, 2E,4E-decadienal supplied in the micromolar concentration range led to a nonspecific cell toxicity. We reexamined NO biosynthesis and response in <i>Phaeodactylum</i>. NO inhibits cell growth and triggers triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation. Feeding experiments indicate that NO is not produced from Arg but via conversion of nitrite by the nitrate reductase. Genome-wide transcriptional analysis shows that NO up-regulates the expression of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> nitrite reductase and genes involved in the subsequent incorporation of ammonium into amino acids, via both Gln synthesis and Orn-urea pathway. The phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is also up-regulated, leading to the production of acetyl-CoA, which can feed TAG accumulation upon exposure to NO. Transcriptional reprogramming leading to higher TAG content is balanced with a decrease of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> via posttranslational inhibition of MGDG synthase enzymatic activity by NO. Intracellular and transient NO emission acts therefore at the basis of a nitrite-sensing and acclimating system, whereas a long exposure to NO can additionally induce a redirection of carbon to neutral lipids and a stress response.</p>

Sucrose and Ethylene Signaling Interact to Modulate the Circadian Clock
<p>Circadian clocks drive rhythmic physiology and metabolism to optimize plant growth and performance under daily environmental fluctuations caused by the rotation of the planet. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s is a key metabolic process that must be appropriately timed to the light-dark cycle. The circadian clock contributes to the regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, and in turn the daily accumulation of sugars from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s also feeds back to regulate the circadian oscillator. We have previously shown that <i>GIGANTEA</i> (<i>GI</i>) is required to sustain Suc-dependent circadian rhythms in darkness. The mechanism by which Suc affects the circadian oscillator in a <i>GI</i>-dependent manner was unknown. Here, we identify that Suc sustains rhythms in the dark by stabilizing GI protein, dependent on the F-box protein <i>ZEITLUPE</i>, and implicate <i>CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1</i> (<i>CTR1</i>), a negative regulator of ethylene signaling. Our identification of a role for CTR1 in the response to Suc prompted a reinvestigation of the effects of ethylene on the circadian oscillator. We demonstrate that ethylene shortens the circadian period, conditional on the effects of Suc and requiring <i>GI</i>. These findings reveal that Suc affects the stability of circadian oscillator proteins and can mask the effects of ethylene on the circadian system, identifying novel molecular pathways for input of sugar to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) circadian network.</p>

Thioredoxin and NADPH-Dependent Thioredoxin Reductase C Regulation of Tetrapyrrole Biosynthesis
<p>In chloroplasts, thioredoxin (TRX) isoforms and NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase C (NTRC) act as redox regulatory factors involved in multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> biogenesis and metabolic processes. To date, less is known about the functional coordination between TRXs and NTRC in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l biosynthesis. In this study, we aimed to explore the potential functions of TRX m and NTRC in the regulation of the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis (TBS) pathway. Silencing of three genes, <i>TRX m1</i>, <i>TRX m2</i>, and <i>TRX m4</i> (<i>TRX ms</i>), led to pale-green leaves, a significantly reduced 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-synthesizing capacity, and reduced accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l and its metabolic intermediates in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The contents of ALA dehydratase, protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase, the I subunit of Mg-chelatase, Mg-protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase (CHLM), and NADPH-proto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>lide oxidoreductase were decreased in triple <i>TRX m-</i>silenced seedlings compared with the wild type, although the transcript levels of the corresponding genes were not altered significantly. Protein-protein interaction analyses revealed a physical interaction between the TRX m isoforms and CHLM. 4-Acetoamido-4-maleimidylstilbene-2,2-disulfonate labeling showed the regulatory impact of TRX ms on the CHLM redox status. Since CHLM also is regulated by NTRC (Richter et al., 2013), we assessed the concurrent functions of TRX m and NTRC in the control of CHLM. Combined deficiencies of three TRX m isoforms and NTRC led to a cumulative decrease in leaf pigmentation, TBS intermediate contents, ALA synthesis rate, and CHLM activity. We discuss the coordinated roles of TRX m and NTRC in the redox control of CHLM stability with its corollary activity in the TBS pathway.</p>

A Dynamic Hydro-Mechanical and Biochemical Model of Stomatal Conductance for C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis
<p>C<sub>4</sub> plants are major grain (maize [<i>Zea mays</i>] and sorghum [<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>]), sugar (sugarcane [<i>Saccharum officinarum</i>]), and biofuel (<i>Miscanthus</i> spp.) producers and contribute ∼20% to global productivity. Plants lose water through stomatal pores in order to acquire CO<sub>2</sub> (assimilation [<i>A</i>]) and control their carbon-for-water balance by regulating stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>S</sub>). The ability to mechanistically predict <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> and <i>A</i> in response to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, water availability, and time is critical for simulating stomatal control of plant-atmospheric carbon and water exchange under current, past, or future environmental conditions. Yet, dynamic mechanistic models for <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> are lacking, especially for C<sub>4</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s. We developed and coupled a hydromechanical model of stomatal behavior with a biochemical model of C<sub>4</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, calibrated using gas-exchange measurements in maize, and extended the coupled model with time-explicit functions to predict dynamic responses. We demonstrated the wider applicability of the model with three additional C<sub>4</sub> grass species in which interspecific differences in stomatal behavior could be accounted for by fitting a single parameter. The model accurately predicted steady-state responses of <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> to light, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and oxygen, soil drying, and evaporative demand as well as dynamic responses to light intensity. Further analyses suggest that the effect of variable leaf hydraulic conductance is negligible. Based on the model, we derived a set of equations suitable for incorporation in land surface models. Our model illuminates the processes underpinning stomatal control in C<sub>4</sub> plants and suggests that the hydraulic benefits associated with fast stomatal responses of C<sub>4</sub> grasses may have supported the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s.</p>

Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Facilitates Synthesis of Photoactive Protochlorophyllide in Etioplasts
<p>Cotyledon cells of dark-germinated angiosperms develop etioplasts that are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s containing unique internal membranes called prolamellar bodies (PLBs). Proto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>lide (Pchlide), a precursor of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l, accumulates in PLBs and forms a ternary complex with NADPH and light-dependent NADPH:proto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>lide oxidoreductase (LPOR), which allows for the rapid formation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l after illumination while avoiding photodamage. PLBs are 3D lattice structures formed by the lipid bilayer rich in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG). Although MGDG was found to be required for the formation and function of the thylakoid membrane in chloroplasts in various plants, the roles of MGDG in PLB formation and etioplast development are largely unknown. To analyze the roles of MGDG in etioplast development, we suppressed <i>MGD1</i> encoding the major isoform of MGDG synthase by using a dexamethasone-inducible artificial microRNA in etiolated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. Strong <i>MGD1</i> suppression caused a 36% loss of MGDG in etiolated seedlings, together with a 41% decrease in total Pchlide content. The loss of MGDG perturbed etioplast membrane structures and impaired the formation of the photoactive Pchlide-LPOR-NADPH complex and its oligomerization, without affecting LPOR accumulation. The <i>MGD1</i> suppression also impaired the formation of Pchlide from protoporphyrin IX via multiple enzymatic reactions in etioplast membranes, which suggests that MGDG is required for the membrane-associated processes in the Pchlide biosynthesis pathway. Suppressing <i>MGD1</i> at several germination stages revealed that MGDG biosynthesis at an early germination stage is particularly important for Pchlide accumulation. MGDG biosynthesis may provide a lipid matrix for Pchlide biosynthesis and the formation of Pchlide-LPOR complexes as an initial step of etioplast development.</p>
