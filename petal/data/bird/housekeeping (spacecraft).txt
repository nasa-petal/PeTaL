Down-regulation of the Sucrose Transporter <i>CsSUT1</i> Causes Male Sterility by Altering Carbohydrate Supply
<p>In plants, male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity is an important agronomic trait, especially in hybrid crop production. Many factors are known to affect crop male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity, but it remains unclear whether Suc transporters (SUTs) participate directly in this process. Here, we identified and functionally characterized the cucumber (<i>Cucumis sativus</i>) CsSUT1, a typical plasma membrane-localized energy-dependent high-affinity Suc-H<sup>+</sup> symporter. <i>CsSUT1</i> is expressed in male flowers and encodes a protein that is localized primarily in the tapetum, pollen, and companion cells of the phloem of sepals, petals, filaments, and pedicel. The male flowers of <i>CsSUT1</i>-RNA interference (RNAi) lines exhibited a decrease in Suc, hexose, and starch content, relative to those of the wild type, during the later stages of male flower development, a finding that was highly associated with male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that numerous genes associated with sugar metabolism, transport, and signaling, as well as with auxin signaling, were down-regulated, whereas most <i>myeloblastosis</i> (<i>MYB</i>) transcription factor genes were up-regulated in these <i>CsSUT1</i>-RNAi lines relative to wild type. Our findings demonstrate that male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity can be induced by RNAi-mediated down-regulation of <i>CsSUT1</i> expression, through the resultant perturbation in carbohydrate delivery and subsequent alteration in sugar and hormone signaling and up-regulation of specific <i>MYB</i> transcription factors. This knowledge provides a new approach for bioengineering male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity in crop plants.</p>

Neutrophils take a round-trip
<p>Inflammation is a body's response to harmful stimuli that aims to eliminate the trigger that caused the initial injury and enable tissue repair. Inflammation can be either pathogen-associated or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>e. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>e inflammation can be triggered by acute conditions, such as trauma, toxin exposure, and ischemia-reperfusion injury, but it is also an important component of life-threatening chronic inflammatory conditions, such as atherosclerosis, cancer, and asbestosis (<i>1</i>). Regardless of etiology, the mechanisms resolving inflammatory responses constitute highly coordinated and active processes that are vital for restoring tissue homeostasis. Although the cellular and molecular signals that drive the initiation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>e inflammation are well studied (<i>1</i>), we have a relatively poor understanding of the mechanisms through which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>e inflammation is resolved, thus limiting our ability to therapeutically tackle harmful inflammation. On page 111 of this issue, Wang <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) shed light on a provocative aspect of resolution by key orchestrators of the inflammatory process: neutrophils.</p>

<i>ESA1</i> Is Involved in Embryo Sac Abortion in Interspecific Hybrid Progeny of Rice
<p>The emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>e individuals in the hybrid backcross progeny of wild and cultivated rice limits the use of wild rice alleles for improving cultivated rice, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity remain unclear. Here, we identified the semi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>e introgression line YIL42, derived from a cross between the <i>indica</i> rice variety Teqing (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and <i>Oryza rufipogon</i> accession YJCWR (Yuanjiang common wild rice), which exhibits semi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity. Using positional cloning, we isolated <i>EMBRYO SAC ABORTION 1</i> (<i>ESA1</i>), which encodes a nuclear-membrane localized protein containing an armadillo repeat domain. A mutation in <i>ESA1</i> at position 1819 (<sup>T</sup>1819<sup>C</sup>) converts a stop codon into an Arg (R) codon, causing delayed termination of protein translation. Analysis of transgenic lines indicated that the difference in ESA1 protein structure between <i>O. rufipogon</i>–derived <i>ESA1</i> and Teqing-derived <i>esa1</i> affects female gamete abortion during early mitosis. Fertility investigation and expression analysis indicated that the interaction between <i>ESA1</i><sup>T1819</sup> and unknown gene(s) of Teqing affects spikelet fertility of the hybrid backcross progeny. The <i>ESA1</i><sup>T1819</sup> allele is present in <i>O. rufipogon</i> but absent in <i>O. sativa</i>, suggesting that variation in <i>ESA1</i> may be associated with interspecific hybrid incompatibility between wild and cultivated rice. Our findings provide insight into the molecular mechanism underlying female <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity, which is useful for improving the panicle seed setting rate of rice and for developing a strategy to overcome interspecific hybrid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity between cultivated rice and wild rice.</p>

The <i>TRAF Mediated Gametogenesis Progression</i> (<i>TRAMGaP</i>) Gene Is Required for Megaspore Mother Cell Specification and Gametophyte Development
<p>In plants, the role of TRAF-like proteins with meprin and the TRAF homology (MATH) domain is far from clear. In animals, these proteins serve as adapter molecules to mediate signal transduction from Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor to downstream effector molecules. A seed-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>e mutant with a disrupted TRAF-like gene (<i>At5g26290</i>) exhibiting aberrant gametogenesis led us to investigate the developmental role of this gene in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The mutation was semidominant and resulted in pleiotropic phenotypes with such features as short siliques with fewer ovules, pollen and seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity, altered Megaspore Mother Cell (MMC) specification, and delayed programmed cell death in megaspores and the tapetum, features that overlapped those in other well-characterized mutants. Seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity and reduced transmission frequency of the mutant alleles pointed to a dual role, sporophytic and gametophytic, for the gene on the male side. The mutant also showed altered expression of various genes involved in such cellular and developmental pathways as regulation of transcription, biosynthesis and transport of lipids, hormone-mediated signaling, and gametophyte development. The diverse phenotypes of the mutant and the altered expression of key genes related to gametophyte and seed development could be explained based on the functional similarly between <i>At5g26290</i> and MATH-BTB domain proteins that modulate gene expression through the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome system. These results show a novel link between a TRAF-like gene and reproductive development in plants.</p>

Nobel honors discoveries in how cells eat themselves
<p>As the stench of the streets during a garbage strike quickly drives home, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sanit</span></strong>ation workers are the unsung heroes of modern cities and towns. Similarly, the cell's garbage collectors are key to health. By performing "autophagy"—literally, self-eating—they degrade or recycle toxic protein aggregates and cell components. This week, the cell biologist who worked out the genetics and mechanics of this process received the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. When Yoshinori Ohsumi, now at the Tokyo Institute of Technology's Frontier Research Center, did his pioneering work in yeast in the early 1990s, his results drew little attention outside cell biology. But in the past 15 years, others have shown that cells' <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clean</span></strong>-up machinery is crucial to human health.</p>

Processes Underlying a Reproductive Barrier in <i>indica</i>-<i>japonica</i> Rice Hybrids Revealed by Transcriptome Analysis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>In rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), hybrids between <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> subspecies are usually highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>e, which provides a model system for studying postzygotic reproductive isolation. A killer-protector system, <i>S5</i>, composed of three adjacent genes (<i>ORF3</i>, <i>ORF4</i>, and <i>ORF5</i>), regulates female gamete fertility of <i>indica-japonica</i> hybrids. To characterize the processes underlying this system, we performed transcriptomic analyses of pistils from rice variety Balilla (BL), Balilla with transformed <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>5+</i>) producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>e female gametes, and Balilla with transformed <i>ORF3+</i> and <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>3+5+</i>) producing fertile gametes. RNA sequencing of tissues collected before (MMC), during (MEI), and after (AME) meiosis of the megaspore mother cell detected 19,269 to 20,928 genes as expressed. Comparison between BL<i>5+</i> and BL showed that <i>ORF5+</i> induced differential expression of 8,339, 6,278, and 530 genes at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. At MMC, large-scale differential expression of cell wall-modifying genes and biotic and abiotic response genes indicated that cell wall integrity damage induced severe biotic and abiotic stresses. The processes continued to MEI and induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as indicated by differential expression of ER stress-responsive genes, leading to programmed cell death at MEI and AME, resulting in abortive female gametes. In the BL<i>3+5+</i>/BL comparison, 3,986, 749, and 370 genes were differentially expressed at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. Large numbers of cell wall modification and biotic and abiotic response genes were also induced at MMC but largely suppressed at MEI without inducing ER stress and programed cell death , producing fertile gametes. These results have general implications for the understanding of biological processes underlying reproductive barriers.</p>

<i>Defective Pollen Wall 2</i> (<i>DPW2</i>) Encodes an Acyl Transferase Required for Rice Pollen Development
<p>Aliphatic and aromatic lipids are both essential structural components of the plant cuticle, an important interface between the plant and environment. Although cross links between aromatic and aliphatic or other moieties are known to be associated with the formation of leaf cutin and root and seed suberin, the contribution of aromatic lipids to the biosynthesis of anther cuticles and pollen walls remains elusive. In this study, we characterized the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>e mutant, <i>defective pollen wall 2</i> (<i>dpw2</i>), which showed an abnormal anther cuticle, a defective pollen wall, and complete male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity. Compared with the wild type, <i>dpw2</i> anthers have increased amounts of cutin and waxes and decreased levels of lipidic and phenolic compounds. <i>DPW2</i> encodes a cytoplasmically localized BAHD acyltransferase. In vitro assays demonstrated that recombinant DPW2 specifically transfers hydroxycinnamic acid moieties, using ω-hydroxy fatty acids as acyl acceptors and hydroxycinnamoyl-CoAs as acyl donors. Thus, The cytoplasmic hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:ω-hydroxy fatty acid transferase DPW2 plays a fundamental role in male reproduction via the biosynthesis of key components of the anther cuticle and pollen wall.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Heterochronic Meiotic Misexpression in an Interspecific Yeast Hybrid
<p>Regulatory changes rapidly accumulate between species, and interspecific hybrids often misexpress genes. Hybrid misexpression, expression levels outside the range of both parental species, can result from <i>cis-</i> and <i>trans</i>-acting regulatory changes that interact abnormally in hybrids. Thus, misexpressed genes may contribute to hybrid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity. However, in the context of a whole organism, misexpression may not result directly from <i>cis–trans</i> interactions but rather indirectly from differences between hybrid and parental abundance of cell types. Here we eliminate the confounding effects of cell types by examining gene expression in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>e interspecific yeast hybrid during meiosis. We investigated gene expression of the yeasts <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, <i>S. paradoxus</i>, and their hybrid at multiple meiotic stages. Although the hybrid and parents exhibit similar changes in expression levels across meiosis, the hybrid meiotic program occurs earlier than either parent. The timing change produces a heterochronic pattern of misexpression during midmeiosis. Coincident with the timing of misexpression, we find a transition from predominantly <i>trans</i>-acting to <i>cis-</i>acting expression divergence and an increase in the number of opposing <i>cis–trans</i> changes. However, we find no direct relationship between opposing <i>cis–trans</i> changes and misexpression. Contrary to the notion that <i>cis–trans</i> interactions cause misexpression, a heterochronic shift in the normal meiotic gene expression program produces patterns of misexpression in an yeast hybrid. Our results imply that temporal dynamics of single cell types is important to understanding hybrid misexpression and its relationship to <i>cis–trans</i> interactions.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Phenotypic rescue of a <i>Drosophila</i> model of mitochondrial ANT1 disease
<p>A point mutation in the <i>Drosophila</i> gene that codes for the major adult isoform of adenine nuclear translocase (ANT) represents a model for human diseases that are associated with ANT insufficiency [<i>stress-sensitive B<sup>1</sup></i> (<i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i>)]. We characterized the organismal, bioenergetic and molecular phenotype of <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> flies then tested strategies to compensate the mutant phenotype. In addition to developmental delay and mechanical-stress-induced seizures, <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> flies have an impaired response to sound, defective male courtship, female <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity and curtailed lifespan. These phenotypes, excluding the latter two, are shared with the mitoribosomal protein S12 mutant, <i>tko<sup>25t</sup></i>. Mitochondria from <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> adults showed a decreased respiratory control ratio and downregulation of cytochrome oxidase. <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> adults exhibited ATP depletion, lactate accumulation and changes in gene expression that were consistent with a metabolic shift towards glycolysis, characterized by activation of lactate dehydrogenase and anaplerotic pathways. Females also showed downregulation of many genes that are required for oogenesis, and their eggs, although fertilized, failed to develop to the larval stages. The <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> phenotypes of developmental delay and mechanical-stress-induced seizures were alleviated by an altered mitochondrial DNA background. Female <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity was substantially rescued by somatic expression of alternative oxidase (AOX) from the sea squirt <i>Ciona intestinalis</i>, whereas AOX did not alleviate developmental delay. Our findings illustrate the potential of different therapeutic strategies for ANT-linked diseases, based on alleviating metabolic stress.</p>

Climate model shows large-scale wind and solar farms in the Sahara increase rain and vegetation
<p>Wind and solar farms offer a major pathway to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clean</span></strong>, renewable energies. However, these farms would significantly change land surface properties, and, if sufficiently large, the farms may lead to unintended climate consequences. In this study, we used a climate model with dynamic vegetation to show that large-scale installations of wind and solar farms covering the Sahara lead to a local temperature increase and more than a twofold precipitation increase, especially in the Sahel, through increased surface friction and reduced albedo. The resulting increase in vegetation further enhances precipitation, creating a positive albedo–precipitation–vegetation feedback that contributes ~80% of the precipitation increase for wind farms. This local enhancement is scale dependent and is particular to the Sahara, with small impacts in other deserts.</p>

High-affinity adsorption leads to molecularly ordered interfaces on TiO<sub>2</sub> in air and solution
<p>Researchers around the world have observed the formation of molecularly ordered structures of unknown origin on the surface of titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) photocatalysts exposed to air and solution. Using a combination of atomic-scale microscopy and spectroscopy, we show that TiO<sub>2</sub> selectively adsorbs atmospheric carboxylic acids that are typically present in parts-per-billion concentrations while effectively repelling other adsorbates, such as alcohols, that are present in much higher concentrations. The high affinity of the surface for carboxylic acids is attributed to their bidentate binding. These self-assembled monolayers have the unusual property of being both hydrophobic and highly water-soluble, which may contribute to the self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clean</span></strong>ing properties of TiO<sub>2</sub>. This finding is relevant to TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalysis, because the self-assembled carboxylate monolayers block the undercoordinated surface cation sites typically implicated in photocatalysis.</p>

‘Frightening’ typhoid fever outbreak spreads in Pakistan
<p>A strain of the bacterium that causes typhoid fever has become resistant to most every drug and is spreading through Pakistan, causing at least 2000 confirmed cases. The so-called extensively drug resistant (XDR) strain of <i>Salmonella typhi</i> remains susceptible to one oral antibiotic, azithromycin, but the only other options are expensive intravenous drugs that most people in Pakistan and other resource-strapped countries cannot afford. The fear is that if <i>S. typhi</i> develops resistance to azithromycin, many people will die from the disease, which leads to bowl perforation and other life-threatening complications in about 15% of untreated people. A new vaccine that for the first time works in young children and has long-lasting immunity is now being rolled out in Pakistan. But antibiotic resistance and spread are a result of poor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sanit</span></strong>ation and contaminated water supplies, which reflect the serious infrastructure problems in Hyderabad and Karachi, the two main cities affected by XDR <i>S. typhi. </i>Public health officials worry that the XDR <i>S. typhi</i> will also jump borders and soon start spreading outside of Pakistan.</p>

A selfish genetic element confers non-Mendelian inheritance in rice

We show that <i>qHMS7</i>, a major quantitative genetic locus for hybrid male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity between wild rice (<i>Oryza meridionalis</i>) and Asian cultivated rice (<i>O. sativa</i>), contains two tightly linked genes [<i>Open Reading Frame 2</i> (<i>ORF2</i>) and <i>ORF3</i>]. <i>ORF2</i> encodes a toxic genetic element that aborts pollen in a sporophytic manner, whereas <i>ORF3</i> encodes an antidote that protects pollen in a gametophytic manner. Pollens lacking <i>ORF3</i> are selectively eliminated, leading to segregation distortion in the progeny. Analysis of the genetic sequence suggests that <i>ORF3</i> arose first, followed by gradual functionalization of <i>ORF2</i>. Furthermore, this toxin-antidote system may have promoted the differentiation and/or maintained the genome stability of wild and cultivated rice.</p>

Volatile chemical products emerging as largest petrochemical source of urban organic emissions
<p>A gap in emission inventories of urban volatile organic compound (VOC) sources, which contribute to regional ozone and aerosol burdens, has increased as transportation emissions in the United States and Europe have declined rapidly. A detailed mass balance demonstrates that the use of volatile chemical products (VCPs)—including pesticides, coatings, printing inks, adhesives, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clean</span></strong>ing agents, and personal care products—now constitutes half of fossil fuel VOC emissions in industrialized cities. The high fraction of VCP emissions is consistent with observed urban outdoor and indoor air measurements. We show that human exposure to carbonaceous aerosols of fossil origin is transitioning away from transportation-related sources and toward VCPs. Existing U.S. regulations on VCPs emphasize mitigating ozone and air toxics, but they currently exempt many chemicals that lead to secondary organic aerosols.</p>

Designing river flows to improve food security futures in the Lower Mekong Basin
<p>Rivers provide unrivaled opportunity for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clean</span></strong> energy via hydropower, but little is known about the potential impact of dam-building on the food security these rivers provide. In tropical rivers, rainfall drives a periodic flood pulse fueling fish production and delivering nutrition to more than 150 million people worldwide. Hydropower will modulate this flood pulse, thereby threatening food security. We identified variance components of the Mekong River flood pulse that predict yield in one of the largest freshwater fisheries in the world. We used these variance components to design an algorithm for a managed hydrograph to explore future yields. This algorithm mimics attributes of discharge variance that drive fishery yield: prolonged low flows followed by a short flood pulse. Designed flows increased yield by a factor of 3.7 relative to historical hydrology. Managing desired components of discharge variance will lead to greater efficiency in the Lower Mekong Basin food system.</p>

Host DNases prevent vascular occlusion by neutrophil extracellular traps
<p>Platelet and fibrin clots occlude blood vessels in hemostasis and thrombosis. Here we report a noncanonical mechanism for vascular occlusion based on neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), DNA fibers released by neutrophils during inflammation. We investigated which host factors control NETs in vivo and found that two deoxyribonucleases (DNases), DNase1 and DNase1-like 3, degraded NETs in circulation during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>e neutrophilia and septicemia. In the absence of both DNases, intravascular NETs formed clots that obstructed blood vessels and caused organ damage. Vascular occlusions in patients with severe bacterial infections were associated with a defect to degrade NETs ex vivo and the formation of intravascular NET clots. DNase1 and DNase1-like 3 are independently expressed and thus provide dual host protection against deleterious effects of intravascular NETs.</p>

Visualizing the function and fate of neutrophils in sterile injury and repair

Here we show that in a fully repairing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>e thermal hepatic injury, neutrophils also penetrate the injury site and perform the critical tasks of dismantling injured vessels and creating channels for new vascular regrowth. Upon completion of these tasks, they neither die at the injury site nor are phagocytosed. Instead, many of these neutrophils reenter the vasculature and have a preprogrammed journey that entails a sojourn in the lungs to up-regulate CXCR4 (C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4) before entering the bone marrow, where they undergo apoptosis.</p>

Sterilizing immunity in the lung relies on targeting fungal apoptosis-like programmed cell death
<p>Humans inhale mold conidia daily and typically experience lifelong asymptomatic clearance. Conidial germination into tissue-invasive hyphae can occur in individuals with defects in myeloid function, although the mechanism of myeloid cell–mediated immune surveillance remains unclear. By monitoring fungal physiology in vivo, we demonstrate that lung neutrophils trigger programmed cell death with apoptosis-like features in <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> conidia, the most prevalent human mold pathogen. An antiapoptotic protein, AfBIR1, opposes this process by inhibiting fungal caspase activation and DNA fragmentation in the murine lung. Genetic and pharmacologic studies indicate that AfBIR1 expression and activity underlie conidial susceptibility to NADPH (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase-dependent killing and, in turn, host susceptibility to invasive aspergillosis. Immune surveillance exploits a fungal apoptosis-like programmed cell death pathway to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>izing immunity in the lung.</p>

Fertile offspring from sterile sex chromosome trisomic mice
<p>Having the correct number of chromosomes is vital for normal development and health. Sex chromosome trisomy affects 0.1% of the human population and is associated with infertility. We show that during reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), fibroblasts from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>e trisomic XXY and XYY mice lose the extra sex chromosome through a phenomenon we term trisomy-biased chromosome loss (TCL). Resulting euploid XY iPSCs can be differentiated into the male germ cell lineage and functional sperm that can be used in intracytoplasmic sperm injection to produce chromosomally normal, fertile offspring. Sex chromosome loss is comparatively infrequent during mouse XX and XY iPSC generation. TCL also applies to other chromosomes, generating euploid iPSCs from cells of a Down syndrome mouse model. It can also create euploid iPSCs from human trisomic patient fibroblasts. The findings have relevance to overcoming infertility and other trisomic phenotypes.</p>

Aggregation of the Whi3 protein, not loss of heterochromatin, causes sterility in old yeast cells
<p>In yeast, heterochromatin silencing is reported to decline in aging mother cells, causing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity in old cells. This process is thought to reflect a decrease in the activity of the NAD<sup>+ </sup>(oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)–dependent deacetylase Sir2. We tested whether Sir2 becomes nonfunctional gradually or precipitously during aging. Unexpectedly, silencing of the heterochromatic <i>HML</i> and <i>HMR</i> loci was not lost during aging. Old cells could initiate a mating response; however, they were less sensitive to mating pheromone than were young cells because of age-dependent aggregation of Whi3, an RNA-binding protein controlling S-phase entry. Removing the polyglutamine domain of Whi3 restored the pheromone sensitivity of old cells. We propose that aging phenotypes previously attributed to loss of heterochromatin silencing are instead caused by aggregation of the Whi3 cell cycle regulator.</p>

Improving efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells with photocurable fluoropolymers
<p>Organometal halide perovskite solar cells have demonstrated high conversion efficiency but poor long-term stability against ultraviolet irradiation and water. We show that rapid light–induced free-radical polymerization at ambient temperature produces multifunctional fluorinated photopolymer coatings that confer luminescent and easy-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clean</span></strong>ing features on the front side of the devices, while concurrently forming a strongly hydrophobic barrier toward environmental moisture on the back contact side. The luminescent photopolymers re-emit ultraviolet light in the visible range, boosting perovskite solar cells efficiency to nearly 19% under standard illumination. Coated devices reproducibly retain their full functional performance during prolonged operation, even after a series of severe aging tests carried out for more than 6 months.</p>

Protein Phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β Protect Centromeric Cohesion during Meiosis I
<p>During meiosis, the stepwise release of sister chromatid cohesion is crucial for the equal distribution of genetic material to daughter cells, enabling generation of fertile gametophytes. However, the molecular mechanism that protects centromeric cohesion from release at meiosis I is unclear in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here, we report that the protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunits B'α and B'β participate in the control of sister chromatid separation. The double mutant <i>b'αβ</i> exhibited severe male and female <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity, caused by the lack of a nucleus or presence of an abnormal nucleus in mature microspores and embryo sacs. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole staining revealed unequal amounts of DNA in the mononuclear microspores. Transverse sections of the anthers revealed unevenly sized tetrads with or without a nucleus, suggesting a defect in meiocyte meiosis. An analysis of chromosome spreads showed that the sister chromatids separated prematurely at anaphase I in <i>b'αβ</i>. Immunoblotting showed that AtRECOMBINATION DEFECTIVE8 (AtREC8), a key member of the cohesin complex, was hyperphosphorylated in <i>b'αβ</i> anthers and pistils during meiosis but hypophosphorylated in the wild type. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that B'α and B'β interact specifically with AtREC8, AtSHUGOSHIN1 (AtSGO1), AtSGO2, and PATRONUS1. Given that B'α was reported to localize to the centromere in meiotic cells, we propose that protein phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β are recruited by AtSGO1/2 and PATRONUS1 to dephosphorylate AtREC8 at the site of centromere cohesion to shield it from cleavage until anaphase II, contributing to the balanced separation of sister chromatids at meiosis.</p>

A Simple Method for Measuring Apoplast Hydration and Collecting Apoplast Contents
<p>The plant leaf apoplast is a dynamic environment subject to a variety of both internal and external stimuli. In addition to being a conduit for water vapor and gas exchange involved in transpiration and photosynthesis, the apoplast also accumulates many nutrients transported from the soil as well as those produced through photosynthesis. The internal leaf also provides a protective environment for endophytic and pathogenic microbes alike. Given the diverse array of physiological processes occurring in the apoplast, it is expedient to develop methods to study its contents. Many established methods rely on vacuum infiltration of an apoplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wash</span></strong> solution followed by centrifugation. In this study, we describe a refined method optimized for maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) seedling leaves, which not only provides a simple procedure for obtaining apoplast fluid, but also allows direct calculation of apoplast hydration at the time of harvest for every sample. In addition, we describe an abbreviated method for estimating apoplast hydration if the full apoplast extraction is not necessary. Finally, we show the applicability of this optimized apoplast extraction procedure for plants infected with the maize pathogen <i>Pantoea stewartii</i> ssp <i>stewartii</i>, including the efficient isolation of bacteria previously residing in the apoplast. The approaches to establishing this method should make it generally applicable to other types of plants.</p>

Importin β4 Mediates Nuclear Import of GRF-Interacting Factors to Control Ovule Development in Arabidopsis
<p>Ovule development is critical for seed development and plant reproduction. Multiple transcription factors (TFs) have been reported to mediate ovule development. However, it is not clear which intracellular components regulate these TFs during ovule development. After their synthesis, TFs are transported into the nucleus a process regulated by karyopherins commonly known as importin alpha and β. Around half of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) importin β-coding genes have been functionally characterized but only two with specific cargos have been identified. We report here that Arabidopsis IMPORTIN β4 (IMB4) regulates ovule development through nucleocytoplasmic transport of transcriptional coactivator growth regulating factors–interacting factors (GIFs). Mutations in <i>IMB4</i> impaired ovule development by affecting integument growth. <i>imb4</i> mutants were also defective in embryo sac development, leading to partial female <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity. IMB4 directly interacts with GIFs and is critical for the nucleocytoplasmic transport of GIF1. Finally, functional loss of <i>GIF</i>s resulted in ovule defects similar to those in <i>imb4</i> mutants, whereas enhanced expression of <i>GIF1</i> partially restored the fertility of <i>imb4</i>. The results presented here uncover a novel genetic pathway regulating ovule development and reveal the upstream regulator of GIFs.</p>

NMT1 and NMT3 <i>N</i>-Methyltransferase Activity Is Critical to Lipid Homeostasis, Morphogenesis, and Reproduction
<p>Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a major membrane phospholipid and a precursor for major signaling molecules. Understanding its synthesis is important for improving plant growth, nutritional value, and resistance to stress. PC synthesis is complex, involving several interconnected pathways, one of which proceeds from serine-derived phosphoethanolamine to form phosphocholine through three sequential phospho-base methylations catalyzed by phosphoethanolamine <i>N</i>-methyltransferases (PEAMTs). The contribution of this pathway to the production of PC and plant growth has been a matter of some debate. Although a handful of individual PEAMTs have been described, there has not been any in planta investigation of a PEAMT family. Here, we provide a comparative functional analysis of two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PEAMTs, NMT1 and the little known NMT3. Analysis of loss-of-function mutants demonstrates that NMT1 and NMT3 synergistically regulate PC homeostasis, phase transition at the shoot apex, coordinated organ development, and fertility through overlapping but also specific functions. The <i>nmt1 nmt3</i> double mutant shows extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity, drastically reduced PC concentrations, and altered lipid profiles. These findings demonstrate that the phospho-base methylation pathway makes a major contribution to PC synthesis in Arabidopsis and that NMT1 and NMT3 play major roles in its catalysis and the regulation of PC homeostasis as well as in plant growth and reproduction.</p>

Transcription Factor OsTGA10 Is a Target of the MADS Protein OsMADS8 and Is Required for Tapetum Development
<p>This study aimed at elucidating regulatory components behind floral organ identity determination and tissue development. It remains unclear how organ identity proteins facilitate development of organ primordia into tissues with a determined identity, even though it has long been accepted that floral organ identity is genetically determined by interaction of identity genes according to the ABC model. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing technique, we identified <i>OsTGA10</i>, encoding a bZIP transcription factor, as a target of the MADS box protein OsMADS8, which is annotated as an E-class organ identity protein. We characterized the function of OsTGA10 using genetic and molecular analyses. <i>OsTGA10</i> was preferentially expressed during stamen development, and mutation of <i>OsTGA10</i> resulted in male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity. OsTGA10 was required for tapetum development and functioned by interacting with known tapetum genes. In addition, in <i>ostga10</i> stamens, the hallmark cell wall thickening of the endothecium was defective. Our findings suggest that OsTGA10 plays a mediator role between organ identity determination and tapetum development in rice stamen development, between tapetum development and microspore development, and between various regulatory components required for tapetum development. Furthermore, the defective endothecium in <i>ostga10</i> implies that cell wall thickening of endothecium is dependent on tapetum development.</p>

Transcription Factor MYB26 Is Key to Spatial Specificity in Anther Secondary Thickening Formation
<p>Successful fertilization relies on the production and effective release of viable pollen. Failure of anther opening (dehiscence), results in male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity, although the pollen may be fully functional. MYB26 regulates the formation of secondary thickening in the anther endothecium, which is critical for anther dehiscence and fertility. Here, we show that although the <i>MYB26</i> transcript shows expression in multiple floral organs, the MYB26 protein is localized specifically to the anther endothecium nuclei and that it directly regulates two <i>NAC</i> domain genes, <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i>, which are critical for the induction of secondary thickening biosynthesis genes. However, there is a complex relationship of regulation between these genes and MYB26. Using DEX-inducible MYB26 lines and overexpression in the various mutant backgrounds, we have shown that MYB26 up-regulates both <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i> expression. Surprisingly normal thickening and fertility rescue does not occur in the absence of MYB26, even with constitutively induced <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i>, suggesting an additional essential role for MYB26 in this regulation. Combined overexpression of <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i> in <i>myb26</i> facilitates limited ectopic thickening in the anther epidermis, but not in the endothecium, and thus fails to rescue dehiscence. Therefore, by a series of regulatory controls through MYB26, NST1, NST2, secondary thickening is formed specifically within the endothecium; this specificity is essential for anther opening.</p>

<i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> Redundancy Fine-Tunes Photoperiod Sensitivity
<p>Three pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) loci controlling photoperiod sensitivity, <i>HIGH RESPONSE</i> (<i>HR</i>), <i>DIE NEUTRALIS</i> (<i>DNE</i>), and <i>STERILE NODES</i> (<i>SN</i>), have recently been shown to correspond to orthologs of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) circadian clock genes <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>ELF3</i>), <i>ELF4</i>, and <i>LUX ARRHYTHMO</i>, respectively. A fourth pea locus, <i>PHOTOPERIOD</i> (<i>PPD</i>), also contributes to the photoperiod response in a similar manner to <i>SN</i> and <i>DNE</i>, and recessive <i>ppd</i> mutants on a spring-flowering <i>hr</i> mutant background show early, photoperiod-insensitive flowering. However, the molecular identity of <i>PPD</i> has so far remained elusive. Here, we show that the <i>PPD</i> locus also has a role in maintenance of diurnal and circadian gene expression rhythms and identify <i>PPD</i> as an <i>ELF3</i> co-ortholog, termed <i>ELF3b</i>. Genetic interactions between pea <i>ELF3</i> genes suggest that loss of <i>PPD</i> function does not affect flowering time in the presence of functional <i>HR</i>, whereas <i>PPD</i> can compensate only partially for the lack of <i>HR</i>. These results provide an illustration of how gene duplication and divergence can generate potential for the emergence of more subtle variations in phenotype that may be adaptively significant.</p>

Defense Responses in Aspen with Altered Pectin Methylesterase Activity Reveal the Hormonal Inducers of Tyloses
<p>Tyloses are ingrowths of parenchyma cells into the lumen of embolized xylem vessels, thereby protecting the remaining xylem from pathogens. They are found in heartwood, sapwood, and in abscission zones and can be induced by various stresses, but their molecular triggers are unknown. Here, we report that down-regulation of <i>PECTIN METHYLESTERASE1</i> (<i>PtxtPME1</i>) in aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>tremuloides</i>) triggers the formation of tyloses and activation of oxidative stress. We tested whether any of the oxidative stress-related hormones could induce tyloses in intact plantlets grown in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>e culture. Jasmonates, including jasmonic acid (JA) and methyl jasmonate, induced the formation of tyloses, whereas treatments with salicylic acid (SA) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) were ineffective. SA abolished the induction of tyloses by JA, whereas ACC was synergistic with JA. The ability of ACC to stimulate tyloses formation when combined with JA depended on ethylene (ET) signaling, as shown by a decrease in the response in ET-insensitive plants. Measurements of internal ACC and JA concentrations in wild-type and ET-insensitive plants treated simultaneously with these two compounds indicated that ACC and JA regulate each other’s concentration in an ET-dependent manner. The findings indicate that jasmonates acting synergistically with ethylene are the key molecular triggers of tyloses.</p>

Resolvase OsGEN1 Mediates DNA Repair by Homologous Recombination<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Yen1/GEN1 are canonical Holliday junction resolvases that belong to the RAD2/XPG family. In eukaryotes, such as budding yeast, mice, worms, and humans, Yen1/GEN1 work together with Mus81-Mms4/MUS81-EME1 and Slx1-Slx4/SLX1-SLX4 in DNA repair by homologous recombination to maintain genome stability. In plants, the biological function of Yen1/GEN1 remains largely unclear. In this study, we characterized the loss of function mutants of <i>OsGEN1</i> and <i>OsSEND1</i>, a pair of paralogs of Yen1/GEN1 in rice (<i>Oryza</i> <i>sativa</i>). We first investigated the role of <i>OsGEN1</i> during meiosis and found a reduction in chiasma frequency by ∼6% in <i>osgen1</i> mutants, compared to the wild type, suggesting a possible involvement of OsGEN1 in the formation of crossovers. Postmeiosis, OsGEN1 foci were detected in wild-type microspore nuclei, but not in the <i>osgen1</i> mutant concomitant with an increase in double-strand breaks. Persistent double-strand breaks led to programmed cell death of the male gametes and complete male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity. In contrast, depletion of <i>OsSEND1</i> had no effects on plant development and did not enhance <i>osgen1</i> defects. Our results indicate that OsGEN1 is essential for homologous recombinational DNA repair at two stages of microsporogenesis in rice.</p>

IRREGULAR POLLEN EXINE1 Is a Novel Factor in Anther Cuticle and Pollen Exine Formation
<p>Anther cuticle and pollen exine are protective barriers for pollen development and fertilization. Despite that several regulators have been identified for anther cuticle and pollen exine development in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), few genes have been characterized in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) and the underlying regulatory mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report a novel male-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>e mutant in maize, <i>irregular pollen exine1</i> (<i>ipe1</i>), which exhibited a glossy outer anther surface, abnormal Ubisch bodies, and defective pollen exine. Using map-based cloning, the <i>IPE1</i> gene was isolated as a putative glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum. Transcripts of <i>IPE1</i> were preferentially accumulated in the tapetum during the tetrad and early uninucleate microspore stage. A biochemical assay indicated that <i>ipe1</i> anthers had altered constituents of wax and a significant reduction of cutin monomers and fatty acids. RNA sequencing data revealed that genes implicated in wax and flavonoid metabolism, fatty acid synthesis, and elongation were differentially expressed in <i>ipe1</i> mutant anthers. In addition, the analysis of transfer DNA insertional lines of the orthologous gene in Arabidopsis suggested that IPE1 and their orthologs have a partially conserved function in male organ development. Our results showed that IPE1 participates in the putative oxidative pathway of C16/C18 ω-hydroxy fatty acids and controls anther cuticle and pollen exine development together with MALE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ITY26 and MALE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ITY45 in maize.</p>

Plant-Specific Preprotein and Amino Acid Transporter Proteins Are Required for tRNA Import into Mitochondria
<p>A variety of eukaryotes, in particular plants, do not contain the required number of tRNAs to support the translation of mitochondria-encoded genes and thus need to import tRNAs from the cytosol. This study identified two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) proteins, Tric1 and Tric2 (for tRNA import component), which on simultaneous inactivation by T-DNA insertion lines displayed a severely delayed and chlorotic growth phenotype and significantly reduced tRNA import capacity into isolated mitochondria. The predicted tRNA-binding domain of Tric1 and Tric2, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>e-α-motif at the C-terminal end of the protein, was required to restore tRNA uptake ability in mitochondria of complemented plants. The purified predicted tRNA-binding domain binds the T-arm of the tRNA for alanine with conserved lysine residues required for binding. T-DNA inactivation of both Tric proteins further resulted in an increase in the in vitro rate of in organello protein synthesis, which was mediated by a reorganization of the nuclear transcriptome, in particular of genes encoding a variety of proteins required for mitochondrial gene expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels. The characterization of Tric1/2 provides mechanistic insight into the process of tRNA import into mitochondria and supports the theory that the tRNA import pathway resulted from the repurposing of a preexisting protein import apparatus.</p>

A Rice Ca<sup>2+</sup> Binding Protein Is Required for Tapetum Function and Pollen Formation
<p>In flowering plants, successful male reproduction requires the sophisticated interaction between somatic anther wall layers and reproductive cells. Timely degradation of the innermost tissue of the anther wall layer, the tapetal layer, is critical for pollen development. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a well-known stimulus for plant development, but whether it plays a role in affecting male reproduction remains elusive. Here we report a role of Defective in Exine Formation 1 (OsDEX1) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein, in regulating rice tapetal cell degradation and pollen formation. In <i>osdex1</i> anthers, tapetal cell degeneration is delayed and degradation of the callose wall surrounding the microspores is compromised, leading to aborted pollen formation and complete male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity. <i>OsDEX1</i> is expressed in tapetal cells and microspores during early anther development. Recombinant OsDEX1 is able to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in vitro, and <i>osdex1</i> exhibited disturbed Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in tapetal cells. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that OsDEX1 may have a conserved function in binding Ca<sup>2+</sup> in flowering plants, and genetic complementation of pollen wall defects of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>dex1</i> mutant confirmed its evolutionary conservation in pollen development. Collectively, these findings suggest that OsDEX1 plays a fundamental role in the development of tapetal cells and pollen formation, possibly via modulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis during pollen development.</p>

Neurohormonal changes associated with ritualized combat and the formation of a reproductive hierarchy in the ant <i>Harpegnathos saltator</i>
<p>Dominance rank in animal societies is correlated with changes in both reproductive physiology and behavior. In some social insects, dominance status is used to determine a reproductive division of labor, where a few colony members reproduce while most remain functionally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>e. Changes in reproduction and behavior in this context must be coordinated through crosstalk between the brain and the reproductive system. We investigated a role for biogenic amines in forming this connection in the ant <i>Harpegnathos saltator</i>. In this species, workers engage in an elaborate dominance tournament to establish a group of reproductive workers termed gamergates. We analyzed biogenic amine content in the brains of gamergates, inside-workers and foragers under stable colony conditions and found that gamergates had the highest levels of dopamine. Dopamine levels were also positively correlated with increased ovarian activity among gamergates. Next, we experimentally induced workers to compete in a reproductive tournament to determine how dopamine may be involved in the establishment of a new hierarchy. Dopamine levels rose in aggressive workers at the start of a tournament, while workers that were policed by their nestmates (a behavior that inhibits ovarian activity) showed a rapid decline in dopamine. In addition to dopamine, levels of serotonin and tyramine differed among castes, and these changes could contribute to differences in caste-specific behavioral patterns observed among non-reproductive workers. Overall, these results provide support that biogenic amines link changes in behavior and dominance with reproductive activity in <i>H. saltator</i> as well as drive differences in worker task performance.</p>

A viral aphrodisiac in the cricket <i>Gryllus texensis</i>
<p>We identified the insect iridovirus IIV-6/CrIV as a pathogen of the cricket <i>Gryllus texensis</i> using electron microscopy (EM) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. EM showed that the virus attacks the fat body, an organ important for protein production, immune function and lipid storage. During infection the fat body hypertrophied, but egg production withered, leaving the lateral oviducts empty of eggs; the females were effectively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>e. EM of the testis of infected males suggests that the testis was not invaded by the virus, although sperm taken from the spermatophores of infected males showed little or no motility. Nevertheless, males and females continued to mate when infected. In fact, infected males were quicker to court females than uninfected controls. The virus benefits from the continued sexual behaviour of its host; transmission studies show that the virus can be spread through sexual contact. Sickness behaviour, the adaptive reduction of feeding and sexual behaviour that is induced by an activated immune system, was absent in infected crickets. Total haemolymph protein was reduced, as was phenoloxidase activity, suggesting a reduction in immune protein production by the fat body. The evidence suggests that during IIV-6/CrIV infection, the immune signal(s) that induces sickness behaviour is absent. Curtailment of a host's sickness behaviour may be necessary for any pathogen that is spread by host sexual behaviour.</p>

Time to Endovascular Treatment and Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Randomized, clinical trials in selected acute ischemic stroke patients reported that for every hour delay of endovascular treatment (EVT), chances of functional independence diminish by up to 3.4%. These findings may not be fully generalizable to clinical practice because of strict in- and exclusion criteria in these trials. Therefore, we aim to assess the association of time to EVT with functional outcome in current, everyday clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The MR CLEAN Registry (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in The Netherlands) is an ongoing, prospective, observational study in all centers that perform EVT in The Netherlands. Data were analyzed from patients treated between March 2014 and June 2016. In the primary analysis we assessed the association of time from stroke onset to start of EVT and time from stroke onset to successful reperfusion with functional outcome (measured with the modified Rankin Scale), by means of ordinal logistic regression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We analyzed 1488 patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent EVT. An increased time to start of EVT was associated with worse functional outcome (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.83 per hour; 95% confidence interval, 0.77–0.89) and a 2.2% increase in mortality. Every hour increase from stroke onset to EVT start resulted in a 5.3% decreased probability of functional independence (modified Rankin Scale, 0–2). In the 742 patients with successful reperfusion, every hour increase from stroke onset to reperfusion was associated with a 7.7% decreased probability of functional independence.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Time to EVT for acute ischemic stroke in current clinical practice is strongly associated with functional outcome. Our data suggest that this association might be even stronger than previously suggested in reports on more selected patient populations from randomized, controlled trials. These findings emphasize that functional outcome of EVT patients can be greatly improved by shortening onset to treatment times.</p></sec>

Cytosolic DNA Sensing Promotes Macrophage Transformation and Governs Myocardial Ischemic Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardium irreversibly injured by ischemic stress must be efficiently repaired to maintain tissue integrity and contractile performance. Macrophages play critical roles in this process. These cells transform across a spectrum of phenotypes to accomplish diverse functions ranging from mediating the initial inflammatory responses that clear damaged tissue to subsequent reparative functions that help rebuild replacement tissue. Although macrophage transformation is crucial to myocardial repair, events governing this transformation are poorly understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Here, we set out to determine whether innate immune responses triggered by cytoplasmic DNA play a role.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We report that ischemic myocardial injury, along with the resulting release of nucleic acids, activates the recently described cyclic GMP-AMP synthase–stimulator of interferon genes pathway. Animals lacking cyclic GMP-AMP synthase display significantly improved early survival after myocardial infarction and diminished pathological remodeling, including ventricular rupture, enhanced angiogenesis, and preserved ventricular contractile function. Furthermore, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase loss of function abolishes the induction of key inflammatory programs such as inducible nitric oxide synthase and promotes the transformation of macrophages to a reparative phenotype, which results in enhanced repair and improved hemodynamic performance.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results reveal, for the first time, that the cytosolic DNA receptor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase functions during cardiac ischemia as a pattern recognition receptor in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>e immune response. Furthermore, we report that this pathway governs macrophage transformation, thereby regulating postinjury cardiac repair. Because modulators of this pathway are currently in clinical use, our findings raise the prospect of new treatment options to combat ischemic heart disease and its progression to heart failure.</p></sec>

NLRP3 Inflammasome Mediates Aldosterone-Induced Vascular Damage
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Inflammation is a key feature of aldosterone-induced vascular damage and dysfunction, but molecular mechanisms by which aldosterone triggers inflammation remain unclear. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a pivotal immune sensor that recognizes endogenous danger signals triggering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>e inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed vascular function and inflammatory profile of wild-type (WT), NLRP3 knockout (<i>NLRP3</i><sup>−/−</sup>), caspase-1 knockout (<i>Casp-1</i><sup>−/−</sup>), and interleukin-1 receptor knockout (<i>IL-1R</i><sup>−/−</sup>) mice treated with vehicle or aldosterone (600 µg·kg<sup>−1</sup>·d<sup>−1</sup> for 14 days through osmotic mini-pump) while receiving 1% saline to drink.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Here, we show that NLRP3 inflammasome plays a central role in aldosterone-induced vascular dysfunction. Long-term infusion of aldosterone in mice resulted in elevation of plasma interleukin-1β levels and vascular abnormalities. Mice lacking the IL-1R or the inflammasome components NLRP3 and caspase-1 were protected from aldosterone-induced vascular damage. In vitro, aldosterone stimulated NLRP3-dependent interleukin-1β secretion by bone marrow–derived macrophages by activating nuclear factor-κB signaling and reactive oxygen species generation. Moreover, chimeric mice reconstituted with NLRP3-deficient hematopoietic cells showed that NLRP3 in immune cells mediates aldosterone-induced vascular damage. In addition, aldosterone increased the expression of NLRP3, active caspase-1, and mature interleukin-1β in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Hypertensive patients with hyperaldosteronism or normal levels of aldosterone exhibited increased activity of NLRP3 inflammasome, suggesting that the effect of hyperaldosteronism on the inflammasome may be mediated through high blood pressure.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Together, these data demonstrate that NLRP3 inflammasome, through activation of IL-1R, is critically involved in the deleterious vascular effects of aldosterone, placing NLRP3 as a potential target for therapeutic interventions in conditions with high aldosterone levels.</p></sec>
