Cardiovascular Risk Prediction Functions Underestimate Risk in HIV Infection
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is elevated in HIV-infected individuals, with contributions from both traditional and nontraditional risk factors. The accuracy of established CVD risk prediction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s in HIV is uncertain. We sought to assess the performance of 3 established CVD risk prediction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s in a longitudinal cohort of HIV-infected men.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The FHS (Framingham Heart Study) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s for hard coronary heart disease (FHS CHD) and atherosclerotic CVD (FHS ASCVD) and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ASCVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> were applied to the Partners HIV cohort. Risk scores were calculated between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2008. Outcomes included CHD (myocardial infarction or coronary death) for the FHS CHD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> and ASCVD (myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary death) for the FHS ASCVD and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ASCVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s. We investigated the accuracy of CVD risk prediction for each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> when applied to the HIV cohort using comparison of Cox regression coefficients, discrimination, and calibration.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The HIV cohort was comprised of 1272 men followed for a median of 4.4 years. There were 78 (6.1%) ASCVD events; the 5-year incidence rate was 16.4 per 1000 person-years. Discrimination was moderate to poor as indicated by the low <i>c</i> statistic (0.68 for FHS CHD, 0.65 for American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ASCVD, and 0.67 for FHS ASCVD). Observed CVD risk exceeded the predicted risk for each of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s in most deciles of predicted risk. Calibration, or goodness of fit of the models, was consistently poor, with significant χ<sup>2</sup> <i>P</i> values for all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s. Recalibration did not significantly improve model fit.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Cardiovascular risk prediction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s developed for use in the general population are inaccurate in HIV infection and systematically underestimate risk in a cohort of HIV-infected men. Development of tailored CVD risk prediction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s incorporating traditional CVD risk factors and HIV-specific factors is likely to result in more accurate risk estimation to guide preventative CVD care.</p></sec>

Predicted Arabidopsis Interactome Resource and Gene Set Linkage Analysis: A Transcriptomic Analysis Resource
<p>An advanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al understanding of omics data is important for elucidating the design logic of physiological processes in plants and effectively controlling desired traits in plants. We present the latest versions of the Predicted Arabidopsis Interactome Resource (PAIR) and of the gene set linkage analysis (GSLA) tool, which enable the interpretation of an observed transcriptomic change (differentially expressed genes [DEGs]) in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with respect to its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al impact for biological processes. PAIR version 5.0 integrates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al association data between genes in multiple forms and infers 335,301 putative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al interactions. GSLA relies on this high-confidence inferred <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al association network to expand our perception of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al impacts of an observed transcriptomic change. GSLA then interprets the biological significance of the observed DEGs using established biological concepts (annotation terms), describing not only the DEGs themselves but also their potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al impacts. This unique analytical capability can help researchers gain deeper insights into their experimental results and highlight prospective directions for further investigation. We demonstrate the utility of GSLA with two case studies in which GSLA uncovered how molecular events may have caused physiological changes through their collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al influence on biological processes. Furthermore, we showed that typical annotation-enrichment tools were unable to produce similar insights to PAIR/GSLA. The PAIR version 5.0-inferred interactome and GSLA Web tool both can be accessed at <ext-link>http://public.synergylab.cn/pair/</ext-link>.</p>

Time to Endovascular Treatment and Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Randomized, clinical trials in selected acute ischemic stroke patients reported that for every hour delay of endovascular treatment (EVT), chances of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al independence diminish by up to 3.4%. These findings may not be fully generalizable to clinical practice because of strict in- and exclusion criteria in these trials. Therefore, we aim to assess the association of time to EVT with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al outcome in current, everyday clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The MR CLEAN Registry (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in The Netherlands) is an ongoing, prospective, observational study in all centers that perform EVT in The Netherlands. Data were analyzed from patients treated between March 2014 and June 2016. In the primary analysis we assessed the association of time from stroke onset to start of EVT and time from stroke onset to successful reperfusion with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al outcome (measured with the modified Rankin Scale), by means of ordinal logistic regression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We analyzed 1488 patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent EVT. An increased time to start of EVT was associated with worse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al outcome (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.83 per hour; 95% confidence interval, 0.77–0.89) and a 2.2% increase in mortality. Every hour increase from stroke onset to EVT start resulted in a 5.3% decreased probability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al independence (modified Rankin Scale, 0–2). In the 742 patients with successful reperfusion, every hour increase from stroke onset to reperfusion was associated with a 7.7% decreased probability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al independence.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Time to EVT for acute ischemic stroke in current clinical practice is strongly associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al outcome.

Cytosolic DNA Sensing Promotes Macrophage Transformation and Governs Myocardial Ischemic Injury

Clathrin Heavy Chain Subunits Coordinate Endo- and Exocytic Traffic and Affect Stomatal Movement
<p>The current model for vesicular traffic to and from the plasma membrane is accepted, but the molecular requirements for this coordination are not well defined. We have identified the <i>hot ABA-deficiency suppressor1</i> mutant, which has a stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> defect, as a <i>clathrin heavy chain1</i> (<i>CHC1</i>) mutant allele and show that it has a decreased rate of endocytosis and growth defects that are shared with other <i>chc1</i> mutant alleles. We used <i>chc1</i> alleles and the related <i>chc2</i> mutant as tools to investigate the effects that clathrin defects have on secretion pathways and plant growth. We show that secretion and endocytosis at the plasma membrane are sensitive to CHC1 and CHC2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> in seedling roots and that <i>chc</i> mutants have physiological defects in stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> and plant growth that have not been described previously. These findings suggest that clathrin supports specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s in multiple cell types. Stomata movement and gas exchange are altered in <i>chc</i> mutants, indicating that clathrin is important for stomatal regulation. The aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> of <i>chc</i> mutant stomata is consistent with the growth phenotypes observed under different water and light conditions, which also are similar to those of the secretory SNARE mutant, <i>syp121</i>. The <i>syp121</i> and <i>chc</i> mutants have impaired endocytosis and exocytosis compared with the wild type, indicating a link between SYP121-dependent secretion and clathrin-dependent endocytosis at the plasma membrane. Our findings provide evidence that clathrin and SYP121 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s are important for the coordination of endocytosis and exocytosis and have an impact on stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>, gas exchange, and vegetative growth in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

c-Cbl Inhibition Improves Cardiac Function and Survival in Response to Myocardial Ischemia
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The proto-oncogene Casitas b-lineage lymphoma (c-Cbl) is an adaptor protein with an intrinsic E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that targets receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, resulting in their ubiquitination and downregulation.

High Fitness Costs and Instability of Gene Duplications Reduce Rates of Evolution of New Genes by Duplication-Divergence Mechanisms
<p>An important mechanism for generation of new genes is by duplication-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence of existing genes. Duplication-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence includes several different submodels, such as sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>alization where after accumulation of neutral mutations the original <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> is distributed between two partially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al and complementary genes, and neo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>alization where a new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> evolves in one of the duplicated copies while the old <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> is maintained in another copy. The likelihood of these mechanisms depends on the longevity of the duplicated state, which in turn depends on the fitness cost and genetic stability of the duplications. Here, we determined the fitness cost and stability of defined gene duplications/amplifications on a low copy number plasmid. Our experimental results show that the costs of carrying extra gene copies are substantial and that each additional kilo base pairs of DNA reduces fitness by approximately 0.15%. Furthermore, gene amplifications are highly unstable and rapidly segregate to lower copy numbers in absence of selection. Mathematical modeling shows that the fitness costs and instability strongly reduces the likelihood of both sub- and neo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>alization, but that these effects can be offset by positive selection for novel beneficial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s.</p>

Sequential Duplications of an Ancient Member of the DnaJ-Family Expanded the Functional Chaperone Network in the Eukaryotic Cytosol
<p>Across eukaryotes, Hsp70-based chaperone machineries display an underlying unity in their sequence, structure, and biochemical mechanism of action, while working in a myriad of cellular processes. In good part, this extraordinary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al versatility is derived from the ability of a single Hsp70 to interact with an array of J-protein cochaperones to form a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al chaperone network. Among J-proteins, the DnaJ-type is the most prevalent, being present in all three kingdoms and in several different compartments of eukaryotic cells. However, because these ancient DnaJ-type proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ed at the base of the eukaryotic phylogeny, little is understood about the evolutionary basis of their diversification and thus the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al expansion of the chaperone network. Here, we report results of evolutionary and experimental analyses of two more recent members of the cytosolic DnaJ family of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, Xdj1 and Apj1, which emerged by sequential duplications of the ancient <i>YDJ1</i> in Ascomycota. Sequence comparison and molecular modeling revealed that both Xdj1 and Apj1 maintained a domain organization similar to that of multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al Ydj1. However, despite these similarities, both Xdj1 and Apj1 evolved highly specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s. Xdj1 plays a unique role in the translocation of proteins from the cytosol into mitochondria. Apj1’s specialized role is related to degradation of sumolyated proteins. Together these data provide the first clear example of cochaperone duplicates that evolved specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s, allowing expansion of the chaperone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al network, while maintaining the overall structural organization of their parental gene.</p>

Density functional theory is straying from the path toward the exact functional
<p>The theorems at the core of density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al theory (DFT) state that the energy of a many-electron system in its ground state is fully defined by its electron density distribution. This connection is made via the exact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al for the energy, which minimizes at the exact density.

We found that these densities became closer to the exact ones, reflecting theoretical advances, until the early 2000s, when this trend was reversed by unconstrained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>als sacrificing physical rigor for the flexibility of empirical fitting.</p>

<p>We generated a global genetic interaction network for <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, constructing more than 23 million double mutants, identifying about 550,000 negative and about 350,000 positive genetic interactions. This comprehensive network <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>s genetic interactions for essential gene pairs, highlighting essential genes as densely connected hubs. Genetic interaction profiles enabled assembly of a hierarchical model of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>, including modules corresponding to protein complexes and pathways, biological processes, and cellular compartments. Negative interactions connected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>ally related genes, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ped core bioprocesses, and identified pleiotropic genes, whereas positive interactions often <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ped general regulatory connections among gene pairs, rather than shared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>ality.

Linking Duplication of a Calcium Sensor to Salt Tolerance in <i>Eutrema salsugineum</i>
<p>The SALT-OVERLY-SENSITIVE (SOS) pathway in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s to prevent the toxic accumulation of sodium in the cytosol when plants are grown in salt-affected soils. In this pathway, the CALCINEURIN B-LIKE10 (AtCBL10) calcium sensor interacts with the AtSOS2 kinase to activate the AtSOS1 plasma membrane sodium/proton exchanger. <i>CBL10</i> has been duplicated in Eutrema (<i>Eutrema salsugineum</i>), a salt-tolerant relative of Arabidopsis. Because Eutrema maintains growth in salt-affected soils that kill most crop plants, the duplication of <i>CBL10</i> provides a unique opportunity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>ally test the outcome of gene duplication and its link to plant salt tolerance. In Eutrema, individual down-regulation of the duplicated <i>CBL10</i> genes (<i>EsCBL10a</i> and <i>EsCBL10b</i>) decreased growth in the presence of salt and, in combination, led to an even greater decrease, suggesting that both genes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> in response to salt and have distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s. Cross-species complementation assays demonstrated that <i>EsCBL10b</i> has an enhanced ability to activate the SOS pathway while <i>EsCBL10a</i> has a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> not performed by <i>AtCBL10</i> or <i>EsCBL10b</i>. Chimeric EsCBL10a/EsCBL10b proteins revealed that the specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s of the EsCBL10 proteins resulted from changes in the amino terminus.

Functional Analysis of Short Linear Motifs in the Plant Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor SIAMESE
<p>Endoreplication, a modified cell cycle in which DNA is replicated without subsequent cell division, plays an important but poorly understood role in plant growth and in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress. The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>SIAMESE</i> (<i>SIM</i>) gene encodes the first identified member of the SIAMESE-RELATED (SMR) family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. <i>SIM</i> controls endoreplication during trichome development, and <i>sim</i> mutant trichomes divide several times instead of endoreplicating their DNA. The SMR family is defined by several short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong> amino acid sequence motifs of largely unknown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>, and family members have little sequence similarity to any known protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al domains. Here, we investigated the roles of the conserved motifs in <i>SIM</i> site-directed Arabidopsis mutants using several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al assays. We identified a potential cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-binding site, which bears no resemblance to other known CDK interaction motifs. We also identified a potential site of phosphorylation and two redundant nuclear localization sequences. Surprisingly, the only motif with similarity to the other family of plant CDK inhibitors, the INHIBITOR/INTERACTOR OF CDC2 KINASE/KIP-RELATED PROTEIN proteins, is not required for <i>SIM</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> in vivo. Because even highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ent members of the <i>SMR</i> family are able to replace <i>SIM</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> in Arabidopsis trichomes, it is likely that the results obtained here for <i>SIM</i> will apply to other members of this plant-specific family of CDK inhibitors.</p>

Variable Effects of C-Terminal Fusions on FLS2 Function: Not All Epitope Tags Are Created Equal
<p>Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) are the largest family of proteins in plants and are responsible for perceiving the vast majority of extracellular stimuli. Thus, RLKs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> in diverse processes, including sensing pathogen attacks, regulating symbiotic interactions, transducing hormone and peptide signals, and monitoring cell wall status. However, despite their fundamental role in plant biology, very few antibodies are available against RLKs, which necessitates the use of epitope tags and fluorescent protein fusions in biochemical analyses such as immunoblot analysis and intracellular visualization. Epitope tags are widely used and are typically assumed to be benign, with no influence on protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>. FLAGELLIN SENSITIVE2 (FLS2) is the receptor for bacterial flagellin and often is used as a model for RLK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>. Previous work implies that carboxyl-terminal epitope fusions to FLS2 maintain protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>. Here, a detailed complementation analysis of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>fls2</i> mutant plants expressing various FLS2 C-terminal epitope fusions revealed highly variable and unpredictable FLS2-mediated signaling outputs. In addition, only one out of four FLS2 epitope fusions maintained the ability to inhibit plant growth in response to flg22 treatment comparable to that in the wild type or control untagged transgenic lines. These results raise concerns over the widespread use of RLK epitope tag fusions for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al studies. Many of the subtleties of FLS2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>, and by extension those of other RLKs, may have been overlooked or inappropriately interpreted through the use of RLK epitope tag fusions.</p>

MAP Kinase PrMPK9-1 Contributes to the Self-Incompatibility Response
<p>Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) form important signaling modules for a variety of cellular responses in eukaryotic cells. In plants, MAPKs play key roles in growth and development as well as in immunity/stress responses. Pollen-pistil interactions are critical early events regulating pollination and fertilization and involve many signaling events. Self-incompatibility (SI) is an important mechanism to prevent self-fertilization and inbreeding in higher plants and also is known to utilize signaling to achieve incompatible pollen rejection. Although several pollen-expressed MAPKs exist, very little is known about their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>. We previously identified a pollen-expressed MAPK (p56) from <i>Papaver rhoeas</i> that was rapidly activated during SI; several studies implicated its role in signaling to SI-induced programmed cell death involving a DEVDase. However, to date, the identity of the MAPK involved has been unknown. Here, we have identified and cloned a pollen-expressed <i>P. rhoeas</i> threonine-aspartate-tyrosine (TDY) MAPK, <i>PrMPK9-1</i>. Rather few data relating to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> of TDY MAPKs in plants currently exist. We provide evidence that <i>PrMPK9-1</i> has a cell type-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>, with a distinct role from <i>AtMPK9</i>. To our knowledge, this is the first study implicating a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> for a TDY MAPK in pollen. We show that PrMPK9-1 corresponds to p56 and demonstrate that it is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>ally involved in mediating SI in <i>P. rhoeas</i> pollen: PrMPK9-1 is a key regulator for SI in pollen and acts upstream of programmed cell death involving actin and activation of a DEVDase. Our study provides an important advance in elucidating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al roles for this class of MAPKs.</p>

Long-Term Biased β-Arrestin Signaling Improves Cardiac Structure and Function in Dilated Cardiomyopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Biased agonism of the angiotensin II receptor is known to promote cardiac contractility. Our laboratory indicated that these effects may be attributable to changes at the level of the myofilaments. However, these signaling mechanisms remain unknown. Because a common finding in dilated cardiomyopathy is a reduction in the myofilament-Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> response, we hypothesized that β-arrestin signaling would increase myofilament-Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> responsiveness in a model of familial dilated cardiomyopathy and improve cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> and morphology.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We treated a dilated cardiomyopathy–linked mouse model expressing a mutant tropomyosin (Tm-E54K) for 3 months with either TRV120067, a β-arrestin 2–biased ligand of the angiotensin II receptor, or losartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker.

Myofilaments of TRV120067-treated Tm-E54K mice had significantly improved myofilament-Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> responsiveness, which was depressed in untreated Tm-E54K mice. We attributed these changes to increased MLC2v and MYPT1/2 phosphorylation seen only in TRV120067-treated mice. We found that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al changes were attributable to an activation of ERK1/2-RSK3 signaling, mediated through β-arrestin, which may have a novel role in increasing MLC2v phosphorylation through a previously unrecognized interaction of β-arrestin localized to the sarcomere.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Long-term β-arrestin 2–biased agonism of the angiotensin II receptor may be a viable approach to the treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy by not only preventing maladaptive signaling, but also improving cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> by altering the myofilament-Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> response via β-arrestin signaling pathways.</p></sec>

MKK6 Functions in Two Parallel MAP Kinase Cascades in Immune Signaling
<p>Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) MAP KINASE (MPK) proteins can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> in multiple MAP kinase cascades and physiological processes. For instance, MPK4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s in regulating development as well as in plant defense by participating in two independent MAP kinase cascades: the MEKK1-MKK1/MKK2-MPK4 cascade promotes basal resistance against pathogens and is guarded by the NB-LRR protein SUMM2, whereas the ANPs-MKK6-MPK4 cascade plays an essential role in cytokinesis. Here, we report a novel role for MKK6 in regulating plant immune responses. We found that MKK6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s similarly to MKK1/MKK2 and works together with MEKK1 and MPK4 to prevent autoactivation of SUMM2-mediated defense responses. Interestingly, loss of MKK6 or ANP2/ANP3 results in constitutive activation of plant defense responses. The autoimmune phenotypes of <i>mkk6</i> and <i>anp2 anp3</i> mutant plants can be largely suppressed by a constitutively active <i>mpk4</i> mutant. Further analysis showed that the constitutive defense response in <i>anp2 anp3</i> is dependent on the defense regulators PAD4 and EDS1, but not on SUMM2, suggesting that the ANP2/ANP3-MKK6-MPK4 cascade may be guarded by a TIR-NB-LRR protein. Our study shows that MKK6 has multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s in plant defense responses in addition to cytokinesis.</p>

Concerted Divergence after Gene Duplication in Polycomb Repressive Complexes
<p>Duplicated genes are a major contributor to genome evolution and phenotypic novelty. There are multiple possible evolutionary fates of duplicated genes.

We studied POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE COMPLEX2 (PRC2) in Brassicaceae. The VERNALIZATION (VRN)-PRC2 complex contains VRN2 and SWINGER (SWN), and both genes were duplicated during a whole-genome duplication to generate FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED2 (FIS2) and MEDEA (MEA), which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> in the Brassicaceae-specific FIS-PRC2 complex that regulates seed development. We examined the expression of <i>FIS2</i>, <i>MEA</i>, and their paralogs, compared their cytosine and histone methylation patterns, and analyzed the sequence evolution of the genes. We found that <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i> have reproductive-specific expression patterns that are correlated and derived from the broadly expressed <i>VRN2</i> and <i>SWN</i> in outgroup species. In vegetative tissues of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), repressive methylation marks are enriched in <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i>, whereas active marks are associated with their paralogs. We detected comparable accelerated amino acid substitution rates in <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i> but not in their paralogs. We also show <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence patterns of the PRC2-associated <i>VERNALIZATION5/VIN3-LIKE2</i> that are similar to <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i>. These lines of evidence indicate that <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i> have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ed in concert, resulting in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence of the PRC2 complexes in Brassicaceae. This type of concerted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence is a previously unreported fate of duplicated genes.

Atypical Protein Phosphatase 2A Gene Families Do Not Expand via Paleopolyploidization
<p>Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) presents unique opportunities for analyzing molecular mechanisms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence between gene family members. The canonical PP2A holoenzyme regulates multiple eukaryotic signaling pathways by dephosphorylating target proteins and contains a catalytic (C) subunit, a structural/scaffolding (A) subunit, and a regulatory (B) subunit. Genes encoding PP2A subunits have expanded into multigene families in both flowering plants and mammals, and the extent to which different isoform <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s may overlap is not clearly understood. To gain insight into the diversification of PP2A subunits, we used phylogenetic analyses to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of PP2A gene families in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Genes encoding PP2A subunits in mammals represent ancient lineages that expanded early in vertebrate evolution, while flowering plant PP2A subunit lineages evolved much more recently. Despite this temporal difference, our data indicate that the expansion of PP2A subunit gene families in both flowering plants and animals was driven by whole-genome duplications followed by nonrandom gene loss. Selection analysis suggests that the expansion of one B subunit gene family (B56/PPP2R5) was driven by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al diversification rather than by the maintenance of gene dosage. We also observed reduced expansion rates in three distinct B subunit subclades. One of these subclades plays a highly conserved role in cell division, while the distribution of a second subclade suggests a specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> in supporting beneficial microbial associations. Thus, while whole-genome duplications have driven the expansion and diversification of most PP2A gene families, members of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>ally specialized subclades quickly revert to singleton status after duplication events.</p>

Dedifferentiation, Proliferation, and Redifferentiation of Adult Mammalian Cardiomyocytes After Ischemic Injury

Cardiomyocyte proliferation in the adult mouse post-MI heart was detected by cell cycle markers and 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine incorporation analysis. Echocardiography was used to measure cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>, and histology was performed to determine infarction size.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In vitro, mononucleated and bi/multinucleated ACMs were able to proliferate at a similar rate (7.0%) in the coculture. Dedifferentiation proceeded ACM proliferation, which was followed by redifferentiation. Redifferentiation was essential to endow the daughter cells with cardiomyocyte contractile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>. Intercellular propagation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from contracting neonatal rat ventricular myocytes into ACM daughter cells was required to activate the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T-cell signaling pathway to induce ACM redifferentiation. The properties of neonatal rat ventricular myocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients influenced the rate of ACM redifferentiation.

First insights into the functional role of vasicentric tracheids and parenchyma in eucalyptus species with solitary vessels: do they contribute to xylem efficiency or safety?
<p>The relationship between hydraulic specific conductivity (<i>k</i><sub><i>s</i></sub>) and vulnerability to cavitation (VC) with size and number of vessels has been studied in many angiosperms. However, few of the studies link other cell types (vasicentric tracheids (VT), fibre–tracheids, parenchyma) with these hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s. <i>Eucalyptus</i> is one of the most important genera in forestry worldwide. It exhibits a complex wood anatomy, with solitary vessels surrounded by VT and parenchyma, which could serve as a good model to investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al role of the different cell types in xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>ing. Wood anatomy (several traits of vessels, VT, fibres and parenchyma) in conjunction with maximum <i>k</i><sub><i>s</i></sub> and VC was studied in adult trees of commercial species with medium-to-high wood density (<i>Eucalyptus globulus</i> Labill., <i>Eucalyptus viminalis</i> Labill. and <i>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</i> Dehnh.). Traits of cells accompanying vessels presented correlations with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al variables suggesting that they contribute to both increasing connectivity between adjacent vessels—and, therefore, to xylem conduction efficiency—and decreasing the probability of embolism propagation into the tissue, i.e., xylem safety. All three species presented moderate-to-high resistance to cavitation (mean <i>P</i><sub>50</sub> values = −2.4 to −4.2 MPa) with no general trade-off between efficiency and safety at the interspecific level. The results in these species do not support some well-established hypotheses of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al meaning of wood anatomy.</p>

The lysine deacetylase Sirtuin 1 modulates the localization and function of the Notch1 receptor in regulatory T cells
<p>The ability to tune cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s in response to nutrient availability has important consequences for immune homeostasis. The activity of the receptor Notch in regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells, which suppress the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s of effector T cells, is indispensable for T<sub>reg</sub> cell survival under conditions of diminished nutrient supply. Anti-apoptotic signaling induced by the Notch1 intracellular domain (NIC) originates from the cytoplasm and is spatially decoupled from the nuclear, largely transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s of NIC. We showed that Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), which is an NAD<sup>+</sup> (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)–dependent lysine deacetylase that inhibits NIC-dependent gene transcription, stabilized NIC proximal to the plasma membrane to promote the survival and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> of activated T<sub>reg</sub> cells. Sirt1 was required for NIC-dependent protection from apoptosis in cell lines but not for the activity of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL. In addition, a variant NIC protein in which four lysines were mutated to arginines (NIC4KR) retained anti-apoptotic activity, but was not regulated by Sirt1, and reconstituted the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s of nonnuclear NIC in Notch1-deficient T<sub>reg</sub> cells. Loss of Sirt1 compromised T<sub>reg</sub> cell survival, resulting in antigen-induced T cell proliferation and inflammation in two mouse models. Thus, the Sirt1-Notch interaction may constitute an important checkpoint that tunes noncanonical Notch1 signaling.</p>

Programmable protein circuits in living cells
<p>Synthetic protein-level circuits could enable engineering of powerful new cellular behaviors. Rational protein circuit design would be facilitated by a composable protein-protein regulation system in which individual protein components can regulate one another to create a variety of different circuit architectures. In this study, we show that engineered viral proteases can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> as composable protein components, which can together implement a broad variety of circuit-level <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s in mammalian cells. In this system, termed CHOMP (circuits of hacked orthogonal modular proteases), input proteases dock with and cleave target proteases to inhibit their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>. These components can be connected to generate regulatory cascades, binary logic gates, and dynamic analog signal-processing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s. To demonstrate the utility of this system, we rationally designed a circuit that induces cell death in response to upstream activators of the Ras oncogene. Because CHOMP circuits can perform complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s yet be encoded as single transcripts and delivered without genomic integration, they offer a scalable platform to facilitate protein circuit engineering for biotechnological applications.</p>

Short-Term Exposure to Nitrogen Dioxide Provides Basal Pathogen Resistance
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) forms in plants under stress conditions, but little is known about its physiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s. Here, we explored the physiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s of NO<sub>2</sub> in plant cells using short-term fumigation of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) for 1 h with 10 µL L<sup>−1</sup> NO<sub>2.</sub> Although leaf symptoms were absent, the expression of genes related to pathogen resistance was induced. Fumigated plants developed basal disease resistance, or pattern-triggered immunity, against the necrotrophic fungus <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and the hemibiotrophic bacterium <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al salicylic acid and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathways were both required for the full expression of NO<sub>2</sub>-induced resistance against <i>B. cinerea</i>. An early peak of salicylic acid accumulation immediately after NO<sub>2</sub> exposure was followed by a transient accumulation of oxophytodienoic acid. The simultaneous NO<sub>2</sub>-induced expression of genes involved in jasmonate biosynthesis and jasmonate catabolism resulted in the complete suppression of JA and JA-isoleucine (JA-Ile) accumulation, which was accompanied by a rise in the levels of their catabolic intermediates 12-OH-JA, 12-OH-JA-Ile, and 12-COOH-JA-Ile. NO<sub>2</sub>-treated plants emitted the volatile monoterpene α-pinene and the sesquiterpene longifolene (syn. junipene), which could <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> in signaling or direct defense against pathogens. NO<sub>2</sub>-triggered <i>B. cinerea</i> resistance was dependent on enhanced early callose deposition and <i>CYTOCHROME P450 79B2</i> (<i>CYP79B2</i>), <i>CYP79B3</i>, and <i>PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT3</i> gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s but independent of camalexin, <i>CYP81F2</i>, and 4-OH-indol-3-ylmethylglucosinolate derivatives. In sum, exogenous NO<sub>2</sub> triggers basal pathogen resistance, pointing to a possible role for endogenous NO<sub>2</sub> in defense signaling. Additionally, this study revealed the involvement of jasmonate catabolism and volatiles in pathogen immunity.</p>

GS<sup>yellow</sup>, a Multifaceted Tag for Functional Protein Analysis in Monocot and Dicot Plants
<p>The ability to tag proteins has boosted the emergence of generic molecular methods for protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al analysi</span></strong>s. Fluorescent protein tags are used to visualize protein localization, and affinity tags enable the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping of molecular interactions by, for example, tandem affinity purification or chromatin immunoprecipitation. To apply these widely used molecular techniques on a single transgenic plant line, we developed a multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al tandem affinity purification tag, named GS<sup>yellow</sup>, which combines the streptavidin-binding peptide tag with citrine yellow fluorescent protein. We demonstrated the versatility of the GS<sup>yellow</sup> tag in the dicot Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) using a set of benchmark proteins. For proof of concept in monocots, we assessed the localization and dynamic interaction profile of the leaf growth regulator ANGUSTIFOLIA3 (AN3), fused to the GS<sup>yellow</sup> tag, along the growth zone of the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) leaf. To further explore the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> of ZmAN3, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ped its DNA-binding landscape in the growth zone of the maize leaf through chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing. Comparison with AN3 target genes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ped in the developing maize tassel or in Arabidopsis cell cultures revealed strong conservation of AN3 target genes between different maize tissues and across monocots and dicots, respectively. In conclusion, the GS<sup>yellow</sup> tag offers a powerful molecular tool for distinct types of protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al analyses in dicots and monocots. As this approach involves <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ing a single construct, it is likely to accelerate both basic and translational plant research.</p>

Identification of Transcriptional and Receptor Networks That Control Root Responses to Ethylene<xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Transcriptomic analyses with high temporal resolution provide substantial new insight into hormonal response networks. This study identified the kinetics of genome-wide transcript abundance changes in response to elevated levels of the plant hormone ethylene in roots from light-grown Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings, which were overlaid on time-matched developmental changes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al annotation of clusters of transcripts with similar temporal patterns revealed rapidly induced clusters with known ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> and more slowly regulated clusters with novel predicted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s linked to root development. In contrast to studies with dark-grown seedlings, where the canonical ethylene response transcription factor, EIN3, is central to ethylene-mediated development, the roots of <i>ein3</i> and <i>eil1</i> single and double mutants still respond to ethylene in light-grown seedlings. Additionally, a subset of these clusters of ethylene-responsive transcripts were enriched in targets of EIN3 and ERFs. These results are consistent with EIN3-independent developmental and transcriptional changes in light-grown roots. Examination of single and multiple gain-of-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> and loss-of-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> receptor mutants revealed that, of the five ethylene receptors, ETR1 controls lateral root and root hair initiation and elongation and the synthesis of other receptors.

A New Barley Stripe Mosaic Virus Allows Large Protein Overexpression for Rapid Function Analysis
<p>Understanding the genetic and molecular bases of gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> is of increasing importance to harness their potential to produce plants with novel traits. One important objective is the improvement of plant productivity to meet future demands in food crop production. Gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> is mostly characterized through overexpression or silencing in transgenic plants. This approach is a lengthy procedure, especially in cereals. Plant viral expression systems can be used for rapid expression of proteins. However, current systems have a small cargo capacity and have mostly been used for gene silencing. Here, a four-component barley stripe mosaic virus-based system with high cargo capacity was constructed for the rapid and stable expression of recombinant proteins in different plant species, allowing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> analyses at different stages of development. Fluorescent marker proteins are expressed at high levels within 1 week, and a proof of efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> analysis is shown using the aluminum malate transporter1 gene. In addition to the ability of gene co<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation, this work demonstrates that the four-component barley stripe mosaic virus-based system allows the overexpression of cDNAs of up to 2,100 nucleotides (encoding a protein of ∼78 kD), thereby providing an invaluable tool to accelerate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al genomics and proteomic research in monocot and dicot species.</p>

Systematic Mutagenesis of Serine Hydroxymethyltransferase Reveals an Essential Role in Nematode Resistance
<p><i>Rhg4</i> is a major genetic locus that contributes to soybean cyst nematode (SCN) resistance in the Peking-type resistance of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), which also requires the <i>rhg1</i> gene. By <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>-based cloning and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al genomic approaches, we previously showed that the <i>Rhg4</i> gene encodes a predicted cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (GmSHMT08); however, the novel gain of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> of <i>GmSHMT08</i> in SCN resistance remains to be characterized. Using a forward genetic screen, we identified an allelic series of <i>GmSHMT08</i> mutants that shed new light on the mechanistic aspects of <i>GmSHMT08</i>-mediated resistance. The new mutants provide compelling genetic evidence that Peking-type <i>rhg1</i> resistance in cv Forrest is fully dependent on the <i>GmSHMT08</i> gene and demonstrates that this resistance is mechanistically different from the PI 88788-type of resistance that only requires <i>rhg1</i>. We also demonstrated that <i>rhg1-a</i> from cv Forrest, although required, does not exert selection pressure on the nematode to shift from HG type 7, which further validates the bigenic nature of this resistance. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping of the identified mutations onto the SHMT structural model uncovered key residues for structural stability, ligand binding, enzyme activity, and protein interactions, suggesting that GmSHMT08 has additional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s aside from its main enzymatic role in SCN resistance. Lastly, we demonstrate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>ality of the <i>GmSHMT08</i> SCN resistance gene in a transgenic soybean plant.</p>

Evolutionary and Functional Analysis of Membrane-Bound NAC Transcription Factor Genes in Soybean
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence is thought to be an important evolutionary driving force for the retention of duplicate genes. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) membrane-bound NAC transcription factor (NTL) genes. NTLs are thought to be components of stress signaling and unique in their requirement for proteolytic cleavage to free them from the membrane. Most of the 15 <i>GmNTL</i> genes appear to have evolved under strong purifying selection. By analyzing the phylogenetic tree and gene synteny, we identified seven duplicate gene pairs generated by the latest whole-genome duplication. The members of each pair were shown to have variously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ed at the transcriptional (organ specificity and responsiveness to stress), posttranscriptional (alternative splicing), and protein (proteolysis-mediated membrane release and transactivation activity) levels. The dormant (full-length protein) and active (protein without a transmembrane motif) forms of one pair of duplicated gene products (GmNTL1/GmNLT11) were each separately constitutively expressed in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The heteroexpression of active but not dormant forms of these proteins caused improved tolerance to abiotic stresses, suggesting that membrane release was required for their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>ality. Arabidopsis carrying the dormant form of GmNTL1 was more tolerant to hydrogen peroxide, which induces its membrane release. Tolerance was not increased in the line carrying dormant GmNTL11, which was not released by hydrogen peroxide treatment. Thus, NTL-release pattern changes may cause phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence. It was concluded that a variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ences contributed to the retention of these <i>GmNTL</i> duplicates.</p>

Sucrose Transporter <i>ZmSut1</i> Expression and Localization Uncover New Insights into Sucrose Phloem Loading

In maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), the <i>Sucrose Transporter1</i> (<i>ZmSut1</i>) gene has been implicated in Suc phloem loading based upon RNA expression in leaves, electrophysiological experiments, and phenotypic analysis of <i>zmsut1</i> mutant plants. However, no previous studies have examined the cellular expression of <i>ZmSut1</i> RNA or the subcellular localization of the ZmSUT1 protein to assess the gene’s hypothesized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> in Suc phloem loading or to evaluate its potential roles, such as phloem unloading, in nonphotosynthetic tissues. To this end, we performed RNA in situ hybridization experiments, promoter-reporter gene analyses, and ZmSUT1 localization studies to elucidate the cellular expression pattern of the <i>ZmSut1</i> transcript and protein. These data showed that <i>ZmSut1</i> was expressed in multiple cell types throughout the plant and indicated that it <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s in phloem companion cells to load Suc and also in other cell types to retrieve Suc from the apoplasm to prevent its accumulation and loss to the transpiration stream. Additionally, by comparing a phloem-mobile tracer with <i>ZmSut1</i> expression, we determined that developing maize leaves dynamically switch from symplasmic to apoplasmic phloem unloading, reconciling previously conflicting reports, and suggest that <i>ZmSut1</i> does not have an apparent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> in either unloading process. A model for the dual roles for <i>ZmSut1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> (phloem loading and apoplasmic recycling), <i>Sut1</i> evolution, and its possible use to enhance Suc export from leaves in engineering C<sub>3</sub> grasses for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis is discussed.</p>

Epistasis and Pleiotropy Affect the Modularity of the Genotype–Phenotype Map of Cross-Resistance in HIV-1
<p>The genotype–phenotype (GP) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> is a central concept in evolutionary biology as it describes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping of molecular genetic variation onto phenotypic trait variation. Our understanding of that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping remains partial, especially when trying to link <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al clustering of pleiotropic gene effects with patterns of phenotypic trait co-variation. Only on rare occasions have studies been able to fully explore that link and tend to show poor correspondence between modular structures within the GP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> and among phenotypes. By dissecting the structure of the GP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> of the replicative capacity of HIV-1 in 15 drug environments, we provide a detailed view of that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping from mutational pleiotropic variation to phenotypic co-variation, including epistatic effects of a set of amino-acid substitutions in the reverse transcriptase and protease genes. We show that epistasis increases the pleiotropic degree of single mutations and provides modularity to the GP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> of drug resistance in HIV-1. Moreover, modules of epistatic pleiotropic effects within the GP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> match the phenotypic modules of correlated replicative capacity among drug classes. Epistasis thus increases the evolvability of cross-resistance in HIV by providing more drug- and class-specific pleiotropic profiles to the main effects of the mutations. We discuss the implications for the evolution of cross-resistance in HIV.</p>

Increased Cardiac Arrhythmogenesis Associated With Gap Junction Remodeling With Upregulation of RNA-Binding Protein FXR1
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Gap junction remodeling is well established as a consistent feature of human heart disease involving spontaneous ventricular arrhythmia.

Impact of Bystander Automated External Defibrillator Use on Survival and Functional Outcomes in Shockable Observed Public Cardiac Arrests
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Survival following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with shockable rhythms can be improved with early defibrillation. Although shockable OHCA accounts for only ≈25% of overall arrests, ≈60% of public OHCAs are shockable, offering the possibility of restoring thousands of individuals to full recovery with early defibrillation by bystanders. We sought to determine the association of bystander automated external defibrillator use with survival and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al outcomes in shockable observed public OHCA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>From 2011 to 2015, the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium prospectively collected detailed information on all cardiac arrests at 9 regional centers. The exposures were shock administration by a bystander-applied automated external defibrillator in comparison with initial defibrillation by emergency medical services. The primary outcome measure was discharge with normal or near-normal (favorable) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al status defined as a modified Rankin Score ≤2. Survival to hospital discharge was the secondary outcome measure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 49 555 OHCAs, 4115 (8.3%) observed public OHCAs were analyzed, of which 2500 (60.8%) were shockable. A bystander shock was applied in 18.8% of the shockable arrests. Patients shocked by a bystander were significantly more likely to survive to discharge (66.5% versus 43.0%) and be discharged with favorable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al outcome (57.1% versus 32.7%) than patients initially shocked by emergency medical services. After adjusting for known predictors of outcome, the odds ratio associated with a bystander shock was 2.62 (95% confidence interval, 2.07–3.31) for survival to hospital discharge and 2.73 (95% confidence interval, 2.17–3.44) for discharge with favorable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al outcome. The benefit of bystander shock increased progressively as emergency medical services response time became longer.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Bystander automated external defibrillator use before emergency medical services arrival in shockable observed public OHCA was associated with better survival and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al outcomes.

Although the role of some histone methyltransferases in establishing the transcriptional program of postnatal cardiomyocytes during heart development has been shown, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> of this class of epigenetic enzymes is largely unexplored in the adult heart. In this study, we investigated the role of G9a/Ehmt2, a histone methyltransferase that defines a repressive epigenetic signature, in defining the transcriptional program for cardiomyocyte homeostasis and cardiac hypertrophy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> of G9a in normal and stressed cardiomyocytes with the use of a conditional, cardiac-specific G9a knockout mouse, a specific G9a inhibitor, and high-throughput approaches for the study of the epigenome (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing) and transcriptome (RNA sequencing); traditional methods were used to assess cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> and cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found that G9a is required for cardiomyocyte homeostasis in the adult heart by mediating the repression of key genes regulating cardiomyocyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> via dimethylation of H3 lysine 9 and interaction with enhancer of zeste homolog 2, the catalytic subunit of polycomb repressive complex 2, and MEF2C-dependent gene expression by forming a complex with this transcription factor.

Patients With Long-QT Syndrome Caused by Impaired <i>hERG</i>-Encoded K<sub>v</sub>11.1 Potassium Channel Have Exaggerated Endocrine Pancreatic and Incretin Function Associated With Reactive Hypoglycemia
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Loss-of-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> mutations in <i>hERG</i> (encoding the K<sub>v</sub>11.1 voltage-gated potassium channel) cause long-QT syndrome type 2 (LQT2) because of prolonged cardiac repolarization. However, K<sub>v</sub>11.1 is also present in pancreatic α and β cells and intestinal L and K cells, secreting glucagon, insulin, and the incretins glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide), respectively. These hormones are crucial for glucose regulation, and long-QT syndrome may cause disturbed glucose regulation. We measured secretion of these hormones and cardiac repolarization in response to glucose ingestion in LQT2 patients with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al mutations in <i>hERG</i> and matched healthy participants, testing the hypothesis that LQT2 patients have increased incretin and β-cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> and decreased α-cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>, and thus lower glucose levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Eleven patients with LQT2 and 22 sex-, age-, and body mass index–matched control participants underwent a 6-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance test with ECG recording and blood sampling for measurements of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, GLP-1, and GIP.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In comparison with matched control participants, LQT2 patients had 56% to 78% increased serum insulin, serum C-peptide, plasma GLP-1, and plasma GIP responses (<i>P</i>=0.03–0.001) and decreased plasma glucose levels after glucose ingestion (<i>P</i>=0.02) with more symptoms of hypoglycemia (<i>P</i>=0.04). Sixty-three percent of LQT2 patients developed hypoglycemic plasma glucose levels (<70 mg/dL) versus 36% control participants (<i>P</i>=0.16), and 18% patients developed serious hypoglycemia (<50 mg/dL) versus none of the controls.

MicroRNA-Based Therapy of GATA2-Deficient Vascular Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The transcription factor GATA2 orchestrates the expression of many endothelial-specific genes, illustrating its crucial importance for endothelial cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>. The capacity of this transcription factor in orchestrating endothelial-important microRNAs (miRNAs/miR) is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial GATA2 was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>ally analyzed in human endothelial cells in vitro. Endogenous short interfering RNA–mediated knockdown and lentiviral-based overexpression were applied to decipher the capacity of GATA2 in regulating cell viability and capillary formation. Next, the GATA2-dependent miR transcriptome was identified by using a profiling approach on the basis of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Transcriptional control of miR promoters was assessed via chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase promoter assays, and bisulfite sequencing analysis of sites in proximity. Selected miRs were modulated in combination with GATA2 to identify signaling pathways at the angiogenic cytokine level via proteome profiler and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Downstream miR targets were identified via bioinformatic target prediction and luciferase reporter gene assays. In vitro findings were translated to a mouse model of carotid injury in an endothelial <i>GATA2</i> knockout background. Nanoparticle-mediated delivery of proangiogenic miR-126 was tested in the reendothelialization model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>GATA2 gain- and loss-of-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> experiments in human umbilical vein endothelial cells identified a key role of GATA2 as master regulator of multiple endothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s via miRNA-dependent mechanisms. Global miRNAnome-screening identified several GATA2-regulated miRNAs including miR-126 and miR-221. Specifically, proangiogenic miR-126 was regulated by GATA2 transcriptionally and targeted antiangiogenic SPRED1 and FOXO3a contributing to GATA2-mediated formation of normal vascular structures, whereas GATA2 deficiency led to vascular abnormalities. In contrast to GATA2 deficiency, supplementation with miR-126 normalized vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> and expression profiles of cytokines contributing to proangiogenic paracrine effects. GATA2 silencing resulted in endothelial DNA hypomethylation leading to induced expression of antiangiogenic miR-221 by GATA2-dependent demethylation of a putative CpG island in the miR-221 promoter. Mechanistically, a reverted GATA2 phenotype by endogenous suppression of miR-221 was mediated through direct proangiogenic miR-221 target genes ICAM1 and ETS1. In a mouse model of carotid injury, GATA2 was reduced, and systemic supplementation of miR-126–coupled nanoparticles enhanced miR-126 availability in the carotid artery and improved reendothelialization of injured carotid arteries in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>GATA2-mediated regulation of miR-126 and miR-221 has an important impact on endothelial biology.

Genetic studies in <i>Drosophila</i> and humans support a model for the concerted function of <i>CISD2</i>, <i>PPT1</i> and <i>CLN3</i> in disease
<p>Wolfram syndrome (WFS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness. WFS1 and WFS2 are caused by recessive mutations in the genes <i>Wolfram Syndrome 1</i> (<i>WFS1</i>) and <i>CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2</i> (<i>CISD2</i>), respectively. To explore the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> of <i>CISD2</i>, we performed genetic studies in flies with altered expression of its <i>Drosophila</i> orthologue, <i>cisd2</i>. Surprisingly, flies with strong ubiquitous RNAi-mediated knockdown of <i>cisd2</i> had no obvious signs of altered life span, stress resistance, locomotor behavior or several other phenotypes. We subsequently found in a targeted genetic screen, however, that altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> of <i>cisd2</i> modified the effects of overexpressing the fly orthologues of two lysosomal storage disease genes, <i>palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1</i> (<i>PPT1</i> in humans, <i>Ppt1</i> in flies) and <i>ceroid-lipofuscinosis</i>, <i>neuronal 3</i> (<i>CLN3</i> in humans, <i>cln3</i> in flies), on eye morphology in flies. We also found that <i>cln3</i> modified the effects of overexpressing <i>Ppt1</i> in the eye and that overexpression of <i>cln3</i> interacted with a loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> mutation in <i>cisd2</i> to disrupt locomotor ability in flies. Follow-up multi-species bioinformatic analyses suggested that a gene network centered on <i>CISD2</i>, <i>PPT1</i> and <i>CLN3</i> might impact disease through altered carbohydrate metabolism, protein folding and endopeptidase activity. Human genetic studies indicated that copy number variants (duplications and deletions) including <i>CLN3</i>, and possibly another gene in the <i>CISD2/PPT1/CLN3</i> network, are over-represented in individuals with developmental delay. Our studies indicate that <i>cisd2</i>, <i>Ppt1</i> and <i>cln3</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> in concert in flies, suggesting that <i>CISD2</i>, <i>PPT1</i> and <i>CLN3</i> might also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> coordinately in humans. Further, our studies raise the possibility that WFS2 and some lysosomal storage disorders might be influenced by common mechanisms and that the underlying genes might have previously unappreciated effects on developmental delay.</p>

Giberellic Acid-Stimulated Transcript Proteins Evolved through Successive Conjugation of Novel Motifs and Their Subfunctionalization
<p><i>Gibberellic Acid Stimulated Transcript</i> (<i>GAST</i>)-like genes encode small polypeptides, some of which have been implicated in diverse biological processes regulating plant growth and development. However, the occurrence of GASTs among plants, their protein structures, and the mechanisms by which they evolved remain elusive. Here, using a customized workflow, we report genes encoding GAST proteins, identify novel motifs and evolutionary patterns contributing to the sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>alization of GAST domains, and explore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al conservation across diverse plant groups. We show that <i>GAST</i>-like sequences evolved initially in the vascular plant <i>Selaginella moellendorffii</i>, after the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence from bryophytes, and later emerged in gymnosperms and angiosperms. GASTs in angiosperms are characterized by four conserved novel motifs; however, relatively fewer conserved motifs exist in pteridophytes and gymnosperms. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the GAST-Cysteine Rich1 motif evolved early in the <i>S. moellendorffii</i> GAST, which further acquired sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>alization through successive conjugation of other motifs and remained conserved across plants, as supported by their col<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong>ity. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al characterization of two orthologs from the dicot Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>; <i>Gibberellic Acid-Stimulated Arabidopsis 10</i>) and the monocot rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>; <i>Gibberellic Acid Stimulated Transcript-Related 9</i>) suggests hormonal regulation, novel roles in seed germination, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al conservation among diverse plant groups.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Characterization of Multiple C2 Domain and Transmembrane Region Proteins in Arabidopsis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Multiple C2 domain and transmembrane region proteins (MCTPs) are evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotic organisms and may <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> as signaling molecules that mediate trafficking of other regulators. Although there are a large number of MCTPs found in the plant lineage, biological information on most plant MCTPs remains unknown. Here, we report systematic characterization of 16 members in the entire Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) MCTP family. Using GUS and GFP reporter assays, we reveal their distinct or overlapping patterns of gene expression and protein localization in developing Arabidopsis plants and <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaf epidermal cells. We further analyze in vivo effects of three C2 domains on the regulatory role of MCTP1 (FTIP1) in flowering time control in Arabidopsis, demonstrating that these C2 domains may be cooperative to mediate FTIP1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> during the floral transition. Through examining all available T-DNA insertional mutants of Arabidopsis <i>MCTPs</i>, we further reveal that <i>mctp6-1</i> significantly enhances the late-flowering phenotype of <i>ftip1-1</i> possibly through affecting FLOWERING LOCUS T in different manners, exemplifying that different MCTPs additively regulate a specific plant developmental process. Taken together, our results suggest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence or redundancy of MCTP members in Arabidopsis and provide a community resource for further understanding various MCTP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>s in plant development.</p>

Targeting Chondroitin Sulfate Glycosaminoglycans to Treat Cardiac Fibrosis in Pathological Remodeling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart failure is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, and the search for novel therapeutic approaches continues. In the monogenic disease mucopolysaccharidosis VI, loss-of-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> mutations in arylsulfatase B lead to myocardial accumulation of chondroitin sulfate (CS) glycosaminoglycans, manifesting as myriad cardiac symptoms. Here, we studied changes in myocardial CS in nonmucopolysaccharidosis failing hearts and assessed its generic role in pathological cardiac remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Healthy and diseased human and rat left ventricles were subjected to histological and immunostaining methods to analyze glycosaminoglycan distribution. Glycosaminoglycans were extracted and analyzed for quantitative and compositional changes with Alcian blue assay and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. Expression changes in 20 CS-related genes were studied in 3 primary human cardiac cell types and THP-1–derived macrophages under each of 9 in vitro stimulatory conditions. In 2 rat models of pathological remodeling induced by transverse aortic constriction or isoprenaline infusion, recombinant human arylsulfatase B (rhASB), clinically used as enzyme replacement therapy in mucopolysaccharidosis VI, was administered intravenously for 7 or 5 weeks, respectively. Cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>, myocardial fibrosis, and inflammation were assessed by echocardiography and histology. CS-interacting molecules were assessed with surface plasmon resonance, and a mechanism of action was verified in vitro.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Failing human hearts displayed significant perivascular and interstitial CS accumulation, particularly in regions of intense fibrosis. Relative composition of CS disaccharides remained unchanged. Transforming growth factor–β induced CS upregulation in cardiac fibroblasts. CS accumulation was also observed in both the pressure-overload and the isoprenaline models of pathological remodeling in rats. Early treatment with rhASB in the transverse aortic constriction model and delayed treatment in the isoprenaline model proved rhASB to be effective at preventing cardiac deterioration and augmenting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al recovery. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong>al improvement was accompanied by reduced myocardial inflammation and overall fibrosis. Tumor necrosis factor–α was identified as a direct binding partner of CS glycosaminoglycan chains, and rhASB reduced tumor necrosis factor–α—induced inflammatory gene activation in vitro in endothelial cells and macrophages.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CS glycosaminoglycans accumulate during cardiac pathological remodeling and mediate myocardial inflammation and fibrosis. rhASB targets CS effectively as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of heart failure.</p></sec>

Association Between Early Hyperoxia Exposure After Resuscitation From Cardiac Arrest and Neurological Disability
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Studies examining the association between hyperoxia exposure after resuscitation from cardiac arrest and clinical outcomes have reported conflicting results. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that early postresuscitation hyperoxia is associated with poor neurological outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a multicenter prospective cohort study. We included adult patients with cardiac arrest who were mechanically ventilated and received targeted temperature management after return of spontaneous circulation. We excluded patients with cardiac arrest caused by trauma or sepsis. Per protocol, partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub>) was measured at 1 and 6 hours after return of spontaneous circulation. Hyperoxia was defined as a Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> >300 mm Hg during the initial 6 hours after return of spontaneous circulation. The primary outcome was poor neurological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> at hospital discharge, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score >3. Multivariable generalized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong> regression with a log link was used to test the association between Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> and poor neurological outcome. To assess whether there was an association between other supranormal Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> levels and poor neurological outcome, we used other Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> cut points to define hyperoxia (ie, 100, 150, 200, 250, 350, 400 mm Hg).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 280 patients included, 105 (38%) had exposure to hyperoxia. Poor neurological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> at hospital discharge occurred in 70% of patients in the entire cohort and in 77% versus 65% among patients with versus without exposure to hyperoxia respectively (absolute risk difference, 12%; 95% confidence interval, 1–23). Hyperoxia was independently associated with poor neurological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> (relative risk, 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.35). On multivariable analysis, a 1-hour-longer duration of hyperoxia exposure was associated with a 3% increase in risk of poor neurological outcome (relative risk, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.05). We found that the association with poor neurological outcome began at ≥300 mm Hg.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Early hyperoxia exposure after resuscitation from cardiac arrest was independently associated with poor neurological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">function</span></strong></span></strong> at hospital discharge.</p></sec>
