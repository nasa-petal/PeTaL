A Violaxanthin Deepoxidase Interacts with a Viral Suppressor of RNA Silencing to Inhibit Virus Amplification
<p>RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing plays a critical role against viral infection. To counteract this antiviral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing, viruses have evolved various RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>s. Meanwhile, plants have evolved counter-counter defense strategies against RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing suppression (RSS). In this study, the violaxanthin deepoxidase protein of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), ZmVDE, was shown to interact specifically with the helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro; a viral RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>) of <i>Sugarcane mosaic virus</i> (SCMV) via its mature protein region by yeast two-hybrid assay, which was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> cells. It was demonstrated that amino acids 101 to 460 in HC-Pro and the amino acid glutamine-292 in ZmVDE mature protein were essential for this interaction. The mRNA levels of <i>ZmVDE</i> were down-regulated 75% to 65% at an early stage of SCMV infection. Interestingly, ZmVDE, which normally localized in the chloroplasts and cytoplasm, could relocalize to HC-Pro-containing aggregate bodies in the presence of HC-Pro alone or SCMV infection. In addition, ZmVDE could <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ate the RSS activity of HC-Pro in a specific protein interaction-dependent manner. Subsequently, transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing of the <i>ZmVDE</i> gene facilitated SCMV RNA and coat protein accumulation. Taken together, our results suggest that ZmVDE interacts with SCMV HC-Pro and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ates its RSS activity, contributing to decreased SCMV accumulation. This study demonstrates that a host factor can be involved in secondary defense responses against viral infection in monocot plants.</p>

F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for tip growth in an array of plant models, including <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion can transport secretory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during secretion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-based transport is necessary to overcome vesicle transport limitations to sustain secretion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion, secretion kinetics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in polarized growth. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we first show that secretory vesicles move toward and accumulate at the tip in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion from actin-mediated transport and measured the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient and concentration of vesicles. Using these values, we constructed a theoretical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-based model for growth, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion kinetics, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion could support normal cell growth rates. We further refined our model to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion kinetics and the size of the secretion zone limit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-based growth. This model predicts that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-mediated growth is dependent on the size of the region of exocytosis at the tip and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-based growth would be significantly slower than normal cell growth. To further explore the size of the secretion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the secretion zone is smaller than 6 μm in diameter at the tip. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active transport in polarized growth and provide important insight into vesicle secretion during tip growth.</p>

Target RNA Secondary Structure Is a Major Determinant of miR159 Efficacy
<p>In plants, microRNA (miRNA)-target complementarity has long been considered the predominant factor determining the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing outcome of the miRNA-target interaction, although the efficacy of such interactions have rarely been appraised in plants. Here, we perform in planta <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing efficacy assays on seven Arabidopsis <i>MYB</i> genes, all of which contain conserved miR159-binding sites of analogous complementarity. These genes were found to be differentially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed by miR159; <i>MYB81</i>, <i>MYB97</i>, <i>MYB101</i>, <i>MYB104</i>, and <i>DUO1</i> were all poorly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed, whereas <i>MYB33</i> and <i>MYB65</i> were strongly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed. Curiously, this is consistent with previous genetic analysis defining <i>MYB33</i> and <i>MYB65</i> as the major functional targets of miR159. Neither the free energy of miR159-target complementarity, nor miRNA binding site accessibility, as determined by flanking region AU content, could fully explain the discrepancy of miR159 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing efficacy. Instead, we found that <i>MYB33</i> and <i>MYB65</i> were both predicted to contain a distinctive RNA secondary structure abutting the miR159 binding site. The structure is composed of two stem-loops (SLs) that are predicted to form in <i>MYB33</i>/65 homologs of species as evolutionary distant as gymnosperms. Functional analysis found that the RNA structure in <i>MYB33</i> correlated with strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing efficacy; introducing mutations to disrupt either SL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ated miR159 efficacy, while introducing complementary mutations to restore the SLs, but not the sequence, restored strong miR159-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing. Therefore, it appears that this RNA secondary structure demarcates <i>MYB33</i>/<i>65</i> as sensitive targets of miR159, which underpins the narrow functional specificity of Arabidopsis miR159.</p>

Developmental Defects Mediated by the P1/HC-Pro Potyviral Silencing Suppressor Are Not Due to Misregulation of <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8</i>
<p>Plant viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>s of RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing induce developmental defects similar to those caused by mutations in genes involved in the microRNA pathway. A recent report has attributed viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>-mediated developmental defects to up-regulation of <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8</i> (<i>ARF8</i>), a target of miR167. The key piece of evidence was that the developmental defects in transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) expressing viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>s were greatly alleviated in the F1 progeny of a cross with plants carrying the <i>arf8-6</i> mutation. <i>Arf8-6</i> is a SALK line T-DNA insertion mutant, a class of mutations prone to inducing transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing of transgenes expressed from the 35S promoter. We have reinvestigated the role of <i>ARF8</i> in viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>-mediated developmental defects, using two independent <i>arf8</i> mutations and the P1/HC-Pro potyviral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing. Progeny of a cross between <i>P1/HC-Pro</i> transgenic Arabidopsis and the <i>arf8-6</i> T-DNA insertion mutant showed little effect on the P1/HC-Pro phenotype in the F1 generation, but almost all <i>arf8-6</i>/<i>P1/HC-Pro</i> progeny had lost the phenotype in the F2 generation. However, the loss of phenotype in the F2 generation was not correlated with the number of functional copies of the <i>ARF8</i> gene. Instead, it reflected transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing of the <i>P1/HC-Pro</i> transgene, as evidenced by a pronounced decrease in P1/HC-Pro mRNA and the appearance of 35S promoter small interfering RNAs. Furthermore, an independent loss-of-function point mutation, <i>Arf8-8</i>, had no detectable effects on P1/HC-Pro phenotype in either the F1 or F2 generations. Together, these data argue against the previously reported role of increased <i>ARF8</i> expression in developmental defects caused by <i>P1/HC-Pro</i>.</p>

Excess Diffuse Light Absorption in Upper Mesophyll Limits CO<sub>2</sub> Drawdown and Depresses Photosynthesis
<p>In agricultural and natural systems, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light can enhance plant primary productivity due to deeper penetration into and greater irradiance of the entire canopy. However, for individual sun-grown leaves from three species, photosynthesis is actually less efficient under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e compared with direct light. Despite its potential impact on canopy-level productivity, the mechanism for this leaf-level <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light photosynthetic depression effect is unknown. Here, we investigate if the spatial distribution of light absorption relative to electron transport capacity in sun- and shade-grown sunflower (<i>Helianthus annuus</i>) leaves underlies its previously observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light photosynthetic depression. Using a new one-dimensional porous medium finite element gas-exchange model parameterized with light absorption profiles, we found that weaker penetration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e versus direct light into the mesophyll of sun-grown sunflower leaves led to a more heterogenous saturation of electron transport capacity and lowered its CO<sub>2</sub> concentration drawdown capacity in the intercellular airspace and chloroplast stroma. This decoupling of light availability from photosynthetic capacity under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light is sufficient to generate an 11% decline in photosynthesis in sun-grown but not shade-grown leaves, primarily because thin shade-grown leaves similarly distribute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e and direct light throughout the mesophyll. Finally, we illustrate how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light photosynthetic depression could overcome enhancement in canopies with low light extinction coefficients and/or leaf area, pointing toward a novel direction for future research.</p>

Fitness Trade-Offs Lead to Suppressor Tolerance in Yeast
<p>Genetic variation among individuals within a population provides the raw material for phenotypic diversity upon which natural selection operates. Some given variants can act on multiple standing genomic variations simultaneously and release previously inaccessible phenotypes, leading to increased adaptive potential upon challenging environments. Previously, we identified such a variant related to a tRNA nonsense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> in yeast. When introduced into other genetic backgrounds, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> led to an increased population phenotypic variance on various culture conditions, conferring background and environment specific selective advantages. Nonetheless, most isolates are intolerant to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> on rich media due to a severe fitness cost. Here, we found that the tolerance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> is related to a surprising level of fitness outburst, showing a trade-off effect to accommodate the cost of carrying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>. To dissect the genetic basis of such trade-offs, we crossed strains with contrasting tolerance levels on rich media, and analyzed the fitness distribution patterns in the offspring. Combining quantitative tetrad analysis and bulk segregant analysis, we identified two genes, namely <i>MKT1</i> and <i>RGA1</i>, involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> tolerance. We showed that alleles from the tolerant parent for both genes conferred a significant gain of fitness, which increased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> tolerance. Our results present a detailed dissection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> tolerance in yeast and provide insights into the molecular basis of trade-offs between fitness and evolutionary potential.</p>

Distinct phases of Polycomb silencing to hold epigenetic memory of cold in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing by Polycomb complexes is central to eukaryotic development. Cold-induced epigenetic repression of <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>) in the plant <i>Arabidopsis</i> provides an opportunity to study initiation and maintenance of Polycomb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing. Here, we show that a subset of Polycomb repressive complex 2 factors nucleate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing in a small region within <i>FLC</i>, locally increasing H3K27me3 levels. This nucleation confers a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed state that is metastably inherited, with memory held in the local chromatin. Metastable memory is then converted to stable epigenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing through separate Polycomb factors, which spread across the locus after cold to enlarge the domain that contains H3K27me3. Polycomb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing at <i>FLC</i> thus has mechanistically distinct phases, which involve specialization of distinct Polycomb components to deliver first metastable then long-term epigenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing.</p>

A Genetic Network for Systemic RNA Silencing in Plants
<p>Non-cell autonomous RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing can spread from cell to cell and over long distances in animals and plants. However, the genetic requirements and signals involved in plant mobile gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing are poorly understood. Here, we identified a <i>DICER-LIKE2</i> (<i>DCL2</i>)<i>-</i>dependent mechanism for systemic spread of posttranscriptional RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing, also known as posttranscriptional gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing (PTGS), in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Using a suite of transgenic <i>DCL</i> RNAi lines coupled with a GFP reporter, we demonstrated that <i>N. benthamiana</i> DCL1, DCL2, DCL3, and DCL4 are required to produce microRNAs and 22, 24, and 21nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), respectively. All investigated siRNAs produced in local incipient cells were present at low levels in distal tissues. Inhibition of <i>DCL2</i> expression reduced the spread of gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing, while suppression of <i>DCL3</i> or <i>DCL4</i> expression enhanced systemic PTGS. In contrast to <i>DCL4</i> RNAi lines, <i>DCL2</i>-<i>DCL4</i> double-RNAi lines developed systemic PTGS similar to that observed in <i>DCL2</i> RNAi. We further showed that the 21 or 24 nt local siRNAs produced by DCL4 or DCL3 were not involved in long-distance gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing. Grafting experiments demonstrated that <i>DCL2</i> was required in the scion to respond to the signal, but not in the rootstock to produce/send the signal. These results suggest a coordinated <i>DCL</i> genetic pathway in which <i>DCL2</i> plays an essential role in systemic PTGS in <i>N. benthamiana</i>, while both <i>DCL4</i> and <i>DCL3</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ate systemic PTGS. We discuss the potential role of 21, 22, and 24 nt siRNAs in systemic PTGS.</p>

An Improved <i>Brome mosaic virus</i> Silencing Vector: Greater Insert Stability and More Extensive VIGS
<p>Virus-induced gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing (VIGS) is used extensively for gene function studies in plants. VIGS is inexpensive and rapid compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing conducted through stable transformation, but many virus-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing vectors, especially in grasses, induce only transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing phenotypes. A major reason for transient phenotypes is the instability of the foreign gene fragment (insert) in the vector during VIGS. Here, we report the development of a <i>Brome mosaic virus</i> (BMV)-based vector that better maintains inserts through modification of the original BMV vector RNA sequence. Modification of the BMV RNA3 sequence yielded a vector, BMVCP5, that better maintained <i>phytoene desaturase</i> and <i>heat shock protein70-1</i> (<i>HSP70-1</i>) inserts in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Longer maintenance of inserts was correlated with greater target gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing and more extensive visible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing phenotypes displaying greater tissue penetration and involving more leaves. The modified vector accumulated similarly to the original vector in <i>N. benthamiana</i> after agroinfiltration, thus maintaining a high titer of virus in this intermediate host used to produce virus inoculum for grass hosts. For <i>HSP70</i>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing one family member led to a large increase in the expression of another family member, an increase likely related to the target gene knockdown and not a general effect of virus infection. The cause of the increased insert stability in the modified vector is discussed in relationship to its recombination and accumulation potential. The modified vector will improve functional genomic studies in grasses, and the conceptual methods used to improve the vector may be applied to other VIGS vectors.</p>

The MAPK Kinase Kinase GmMEKK1 Regulates Cell Death and Defense Responses

Surprisingly, a strong hypersensitive response (HR) cell death was observed when soybean <i>MAPK KINASE KINASE1</i> (<i>GmMEKK1</i>), a homolog of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>MEKK1</i>, was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed. The HR was accompanied by the overaccumulation of defense signaling molecules, salicylic acid (SA) and hydrogen peroxide. Genes involved in primary metabolism, translation/transcription, photosynthesis, and growth/development were down-regulated in <i>GmMEKK1-</i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed plants, while the expression of defense-related genes was activated. Accordingly, <i>GmMEKK1</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed plants were more resistant to downy mildew (<i>Peronospora manshurica</i>) and <i>Soybean mosaic virus</i> compared with control plants. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing <i>GmMEKK1</i> reduced the activation of GmMPK6 but enhanced the activation of <i>Gm</i>MPK3 in response to flg22 peptide. Unlike Arabidopsis MPK4, <i>Gm</i>MPK4 was not activated by either flg22 or SA. Interestingly, transient overexpression of <i>GmMEKK1</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> also induced HR. Our results indicate that <i>Gm</i>MEKK1 plays both positive and negative roles in immunity and appears to differentially activate downstream MPKs by promoting <i>Gm</i>MPK6 activation but suppressing GmMPK3 activation in response to flg22. The involvement of <i>Gm</i>MPK4 kinase activity in cell death and in flg22- or SA-triggered defense responses in soybean requires further investigation.</p>

The Potato MAP3K StVIK Is Required for the <i>Phytophthora infestans</i> RXLR Effector Pi17316 to Promote Disease
<p>Plant pathogens deliver effectors to manipulate processes in their hosts, creating a suitable environment for invasion and proliferation. Yet, little is known about the host proteins that are targeted by effectors from filamentous pathogens. Here, we show that stable transgenic expression in potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) and transient expression in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> of the arginine-any amino acid-leucine-arginine effector Pi17316 enhances leaf colonization by the late blight pathogen <i>Phytophthora infestans</i>. Expression of Pi17316 also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ates cell death triggered by the pathogen-associated molecular pattern Infestin1 (INF1), indicating that the effector suppresses pattern-triggered immunity. However, this effector does not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ate cell death triggered by a range of resistance proteins, showing that it specifically suppresses INF1-triggered cell death (ICD). In yeast two-hybrid assays, Pi17316 interacts directly with the potato ortholog of VASCULAR HIGHWAY1-interacting kinase (StVIK), encoding a predicted MEK kinase (MAP3K). Interaction in planta was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and occurs at the plant plasma membrane. Virus-induced gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing of <i>VIK</i> in <i>N. benthamiana</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ated <i>P. infestans</i> colonization, whereas transient overexpression of <i>StVIK</i> enhanced colonization, indicating that this host protein acts as a susceptibility factor. Moreover, <i>VIK</i> overexpression specifically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ated ICD, indicating that it is a negative regulator of immunity. The abilities of Pi17316 to enhance <i>P. infestans</i> colonization or suppress ICD were compromised significantly in <i>NbVIK</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed plants, demonstrating that the effector activity of Pi17316 is mediated by this MAP3K. Thus, StVIK is exploited by <i>P. infestans</i> as a susceptibility factor to promote late blight disease.</p>

Hindered cytoplasmic diffusion of inositol trisphosphate restricts its cellular range of action
<p>The range of action of intracellular messengers is determined by their rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion and degradation. Previous measurements in oocyte cytoplasmic extracts indicated that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-liberating second messenger inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>es with a coefficient (~280 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) similar to that in water, corresponding to a range of action of ~25 μm. Consequently, IP<sub>3</sub> is generally considered a “global” cellular messenger. We reexamined this issue by measuring local IP<sub>3</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs to monitor IP<sub>3</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ing from spot photorelease in neuroblastoma cells. Fitting these data by numerical simulations yielded a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient (≤10 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) about 30-fold slower than that previously reported. We propose that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of IP<sub>3</sub> in mammalian cells is hindered by binding to immobile, functionally inactive receptors that were diluted in oocyte extracts. The predicted range of action of IP<sub>3</sub> (<5 μm) is thus smaller than the size of typical mammalian cells, indicating that IP<sub>3</sub> should better be considered as a local rather than a global cellular messenger.</p>

Xist recruits the X chromosome to the nuclear lamina to enable chromosome-wide silencing

An Ethylene-Induced Regulatory Module Delays Flower Senescence by Regulating Cytokinin Content
<p>In many plant species, including rose (<i>Rosa hybrida</i>), flower senescence is promoted by the gaseous hormone ethylene and inhibited by the cytokinin (CTK) class of hormones. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these antagonistic effects are not well understood. In this study, we characterized the association between a pathogenesis-related PR-10 family gene from rose (<i>RhPR10.1</i>) and the hormonal regulation of flower senescence. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis showed that <i>RhPR10.1</i> was expressed at high levels during senescence in different floral organs, including petal, sepal, receptacle, stamen, and pistil, and that expression was induced by ethylene treatment. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing of <i>RhPR10.1</i> expression in rose plants by virus-induced gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing accelerated flower senescence, which was accompanied by a higher ion leakage rate in the petals, as well as increased expression of the senescence marker gene <i>RhSAG12</i>. CTK content and the expression of three CTK signaling pathway genes were reduced in <i>RhPR10.1</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed plants, and the accelerated rate of petal senescence that was apparent in the <i>RhPR10.1</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed plants was restored to normal levels by CTK treatment. Finally, RhHB6, a homeodomain-Leu zipper I transcription factor, was observed to bind to the <i>RhPR10.1</i> promoter, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing of its expression also promoted flower senescence. Our results reveal an ethylene-induced RhHB6-RhPR10.1 regulatory module that functions as a brake of ethylene-promoted senescence through increasing the CTK content.</p>

Single-molecule diffusion-based estimation of ligand effects on G protein–coupled receptors
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major drug targets. Developing a method to measure the activities of GPCRs is essential for pharmacology and drug screening. However, it is difficult to measure the effects of a drug by monitoring the receptor on the cell surface; thus, changes in the concentrations of downstream signaling molecules, which depend on the signaling pathway selectivity of the receptor, are often used as an index of receptor activity. We show that single-molecule imaging analysis provides an alternative method for assessing the effects of ligands on GPCRs. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), we monitored the dynamics of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3), a class C GPCR, under various ligand conditions. Our single-molecule tracking analysis demonstrated that increases and decreases in the average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient of mGluR3 quantitatively reflected the ligand-dependent inactivation and activation of receptors, respectively. Through experiments with inhibitors and dual-color single-molecule imaging analysis, we found that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of receptor molecules was altered by common physiological events associated with GPCRs, including G protein binding, and receptor accumulation in clathrin-coated pits. We also confirmed that agonist also decreased the average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient for class A and B GPCRs, demonstrating that this parameter is a good index for estimating ligand effects on many GPCRs regardless of their phylogenetic groups, the chemical properties of the ligands, or G protein–coupling selectivity.</p>

Reduced abundance of the E3 ubiquitin ligase E6AP contributes to decreased expression of the <i>INK4/ARF</i> locus in non–small cell lung cancer
<p>The tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> p16<sup>INK4a</sup>, one protein encoded by the <i>INK4/ARF</i> locus, is frequently absent in multiple cancers, including non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Whereas increased methylation of the encoding gene (<i>CDKN2A</i>) accounts for its loss in a third of patients, no molecular explanation exists for the remainder. We unraveled an alternative mechanism for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing of the <i>INK4/ARF</i> locus involving the E3 ubiquitin ligase and transcriptional cofactor E6AP (also known as UBE3A). We found that the expression of three tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> genes encoded in the <i>INK4/ARF</i> locus (<i>p15</i><sup><i>INK4b</i></sup>, <i>p16</i><sup><i>INK4a</i></sup>, and <i>p19</i><sup><i>ARF</i></sup>) was decreased in <i>E6AP</i><sup><i>−/−</i></sup> mouse embryo fibroblasts. E6AP induced the expression of the <i>INK4/ARF</i> locus at the transcriptional level by inhibiting <i>CDC6</i> transcription, a gene encoding a key repressor of the locus. Luciferase assays revealed that E6AP inhibited <i>CDC6</i> expression by reducing its E2F1-dependent transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that E6AP reduced the amount of E2F1 at the <i>CDC6</i> promoter. In a subset of NSCLC samples, an E6AP-low/CDC6-high/p16<sup>INK4a</sup>-low protein abundance profile correlated with low methylation of the gene encoding p16<sup>INK4a</sup> (<i>CDKN2A</i>) and poor patient prognosis. These findings define a previously unrecognized tumor-suppressive role for E6AP in NSCLC, reveal an alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing mechanism of the <i>INK4/ARF</i> locus, and reveal E6AP as a potential prognostic marker in NSCLC.</p>

Reactivation of recall-induced neurons contributes to remote fear memory attenuation
<p>Whether fear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ation is mediated by inhibition of the original memory trace of fear with a new memory trace of safety or by updating of the original fear trace toward safety has been a long-standing question in neuroscience and psychology alike. In particular, which of the two scenarios underlies the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ation of remote (month-old) fear memories is completely unknown, despite the impetus to better understand this process against the backdrop of enduring traumata. We found—chemogenetically and in an engram-specific manner—that effective remote fear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ation is accompanied by the reactivation of memory recall–induced neurons in the dentate gyrus and that the continued activity of these neurons is critical for fear reduction.

When early adopters don't adopt
<p>Individuals who naturally adopt a new technology early are important for influencing whether and how the technology <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>es more broadly among later users (<i>1</i>–<i>7</i>). Such natural early adopters (NEAs) may influence the difference between successful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of new technology and failure.

We asked, “What if natural early adopters are not able to adopt early?” This paper is the first to measure the counterfactual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion curve that occurs when NEAs are not allowed to adopt early. The results suggest that NEAs can stifle broader <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of a technology if their usual ability to be first—and to derive value from being first—is compromised. Small changes in the initial availability of a technology among different types of users can have a lasting effect on its potential.</p>

BZR1 Mediates Brassinosteroid-Induced Autophagy and Nitrogen Starvation in Tomato
<p>Autophagy, an innate cellular destructive mechanism, plays crucial roles in plant development and responses to stress. Autophagy is known to be stimulated or suppressed by multiple molecular processes, but the role of phytohormone signaling in autophagy is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the transcripts of autophagy-related genes (<i>ATGs</i>) and the formation of autophagosomes are triggered by enhanced levels of brassinosteroid (BR). Furthermore, the BR-activated transcription factor brassinazole-resistant1 (BZR1), a positive regulator of the BR signaling pathway, is involved in BR-induced autophagy. Treatment with BR enhanced the formation of autophagosomes and the transcripts of <i>ATGs</i> in <i>BZR1</i>-overexpressing plants, while the effects of BR were compromised in <i>BZR1</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed plants. Yeast one-hybrid analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that BZR1 bound to the promoters of <i>ATG2</i> and <i>ATG6</i>. The BR-induced formation of autophagosomes decreased in <i>ATG2</i>- and <i>ATG6</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed plants. Moreover, exogenous application of BR enhanced chlorophyll content and autophagosome formation and decreased the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins under nitrogen starvation. Leaf chlorosis and chlorophyll degradation were exacerbated in <i>BZR1</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed plants and the BR biosynthetic mutant <i>d<sup>^im</sup></i> but were alleviated in <i>BZR1</i>- and <i>BZR1-1D</i>-overexpressing plants under nitrogen starvation. Meanwhile, nitrogen starvation-induced expression of <i>ATGs</i> and autophagosome formation were compromised in both <i>BZR1</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed and <i>d<sup>^im</sup></i> plants but were increased in <i>BZR1</i>- and <i>BZR1-1D</i>-overexpressing plants. Taken together, our results suggest that BZR1-dependent BR signaling up-regulates the expression of <i>ATGs</i> and autophagosome formation, which plays a critical role in the plant response to nitrogen starvation in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>).</p>

METHIONINE ADENOSYLTRANSFERASE4 Mediates DNA and Histone Methylation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>DNA and histone methylation coregulate heterochromatin formation and gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing in animals and plants. To identify factors involved in maintaining gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing, we conducted a forward genetic screen for mutants that release the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed transgene <i>Pro35S::NEOMYCIN PHOSPHOTRANSFERASE II</i> in the transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) line <i>L119</i>. We identified <i>MAT4/SAMS3/MTO3/AT3G17390</i>, which encodes methionine (Met) adenosyltransferase 4 (MAT4)/<i>S</i>-adenosyl-Met synthetase 3 that catalyzes the synthesis of <i>S</i>-adenosyl-Met (SAM) in the one-carbon metabolism cycle. <i>mat4</i> mostly decreases CHG and CHH DNA methylation and histone H3K9me2 and reactivates certain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed transposons. The exogenous addition of SAM partially rescues the epigenetic defects of <i>mat4</i>. SAM content and DNA methylation were reduced more in <i>mat4</i> than in three other <i>mat</i> mutants. <i>MAT4</i> knockout mutations generated by CRISPR/Cas9 were lethal, indicating that <i>MAT4</i> is an essential gene in Arabidopsis. MAT1, 2, and 4 proteins exhibited nearly equal activity in an in vitro assay, whereas MAT3 exhibited higher activity. The native <i>MAT4</i> promoter driving <i>MAT1</i>, <i>2</i>, and <i>3</i> cDNA complemented the <i>mat4</i> mutant. However, most <i>mat4</i> transgenic lines carrying native <i>MAT1</i>, <i>2</i>, and <i>3</i> promoters driving <i>MAT4</i> cDNA did not complement the <i>mat4</i> mutant because of their lower expression in seedlings. Genetic analyses indicated that the <i>mat1mat4</i> double mutant is dwarfed and the <i>mat2mat4</i> double mutant was nonviable, while <i>mat1mat2</i> showed normal growth and fertility. These results indicate that MAT4 plays a predominant role in SAM production, plant growth, and development. Our findings provide direct evidence of the cooperative actions between metabolism and epigenetic regulation.</p>

Extended Vernalization Regulates Inflorescence Fate in <i>Arabis alpina</i> by Stably Silencing <i>PERPETUAL FLOWERING1</i>
<p>The alpine perennial <i>Arabis alpina</i> initiates flower buds during prolonged exposure to cold. In the accession Pajares, we demonstrate that the length of vernalization influences flowering time and inflorescence fate but does not affect the axillary branches that maintain vegetative growth. The expression of floral organ identity genes gradually increases in the main shoot apex during vernalization, correlating with an increase in floral commitment. In northern Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accessions, the length of vernalization modulates the stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing of the floral repressor <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>). We demonstrate that expression of <i>PERPETUAL FLOWERING1</i> (<i>PEP1</i>), the ortholog of <i>FLC</i> in <i>A. alpina</i>, is similarly influenced by the duration of the exposure to cold. Extended vernalization results in stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing of <i>PEP1</i> in the inflorescence. In contrast, insufficient vernalization leads to <i>PEP1</i> reactivation after cold treatment, which correlates with delayed flowering and the appearance of floral reversion phenotypes such as bracts and vegetative inflorescence branches. Floral reversion phenotypes are reduced in the <i>pep1-1</i> mutant, suggesting that <i>PEP1</i> regulates the fate of the inflorescence after vernalization. The effect of vernalization duration on stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing of <i>PEP1</i> is specific to meristems that initiate flowering during cold treatment. Extended vernalization fails to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>e <i>PEP1</i> in young seedlings and axillary branches that arise from buds initiated during cold treatment, which remain vegetative. We conclude that the duration of vernalization in <i>A. alpina</i> differentially regulates <i>PEP1</i> in the inflorescence and axillary branches. <i>PEP1</i> has a dual role regulating meristem fate; it prevents meristems from flowering and antagonizes inflorescence development after vernalization.</p>

Phospholipase C2 Affects MAMP-Triggered Immunity by Modulating ROS Production
<p>The activation of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) is one of the earliest responses triggered by the recognition of several microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) in plants. The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PI-PLC gene family is composed of nine members. Previous studies suggested a role for PLC2 in MAMP-triggered immunity, as it is rapidly phosphorylated in vivo upon treatment with the bacterial MAMP flg22. Here, we analyzed the role of PLC2 in plant immunity using an artificial microRNA to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>e <i>PLC2</i> expression in Arabidopsis. We found that <i>PLC2</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed plants are more susceptible to the type III secretion system-deficient bacterial strain <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> (<i>Pst</i>) DC3000 <i>hrcC<sup>−</sup></i> and to the nonadapted pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) powdery mildew <i>Erysiphe pisi</i>. However, <i>PLC2</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed plants display normal susceptibility to virulent (<i>Pst</i> DC3000) and avirulent (<i>Pst</i> DC3000 AvrRPM1) <i>P. syringae</i> strains, conserving typical hypersensitive response features. In response to flg22, <i>PLC2</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed plants maintain wild-type mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and <i>PHI1</i>, <i>WRKY33</i>, and <i>FRK1</i> immune marker gene expression but have reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent responses such as callose deposition and stomatal closure. Accordingly, the generation of ROS upon flg22 treatment is compromised in the <i>PLC2</i>-defficient plants, suggesting an effect of PLC2 in a branch of MAMP-triggered immunity and nonhost resistance that involves early ROS-regulated processes. Consistently, PLC2 associates with the NADPH oxidase RBOHD, suggesting its potential regulation by PLC2.</p>

Transcriptional Gene Silencing Maintained by OTS1 SUMO Protease Requires a DNA-Dependent Polymerase V-Dependent Pathway
<p>The expression of genes with aberrant structure is prevented at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation levels. Aberrant gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing at the posttranscriptional level is well studied; however, it is not well understood how aberrant genes are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed at the transcriptional level. In this study, through genetic screening a transgenic report line that harbors an aberrant gene (<i>35S-LUC</i>, lacking 3′-untranslated region [3′-UTR]) and lacks luciferase (LUC) activity, we identify that the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protease <i>OTS1</i> gene is required for maintaining the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>e of the reporter <i>35S-LUC</i> and an endogenous mutator-like element <i>MULE-F19G14</i> at the transcriptional level, which requires DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol) V and DDR complex, but not Pol IV. The increased transcripts in <i>ots1</i> mutants are terminated by the 3′-UTRs of downstream genes. In addition to <i>ots1</i> mutations, mutations in several known or putative SUMO proteases and two SUMO E3 ligases, <i>SIZ1</i> and <i>MMS21</i>, have similar effects on this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing regulation. Taken together, our results reveal that the enzymes involved in the SUMOylation process restrain aberrant gene transcription by using a downstream gene 3′-UTR, and this regulation requires a functional Pol V-dependent pathway in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

An E3 Ligase Affects the NLR Receptor Stability and Immunity to Powdery Mildew
<p>Following the detection of pathogen cognate effectors, plant Nod-like receptors (NLRs) trigger isolate-specific immunity that is generally associated with cell death. The regulation of NLR stability is important to ensure effective immunity. In barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), the allelic Mildew locus A (MLA) receptors mediate isolate-specific disease resistance against powdery mildew fungus (<i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i>). Currently, how MLA stability is controlled remains unknown. Here, we identified an MLA-interacting RING-type E3 ligase, MIR1, that interacts with several MLAs. We showed that the carboxyl-terminal TPR domain of MIR1 mediates the interaction with the coiled-coil domain-containing region of functional MLAs, such as MLA1, MLA6, and MLA10, but not with that of the nonfunctional MLA18-1. MIR1 can ubiquitinate the amino-terminal region of MLAs in vitro and promotes the proteasomal degradation of MLAs in vitro and in planta. Both proteasome inhibitor treatment and virus-induced gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing-mediated <i>MIR1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing significantly increased MLA abundance in barley transgenic lines. Furthermore, overexpression of MIR1 specifically compromised MLA-mediated disease resistance in barley, while coexpression of MIR1 and MLA10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ated MLA10-induced cell death signaling in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Together, our data reveal a mechanism for the control of the stability of MLA immune receptors and for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ation of MLA-triggered defense signaling by a RING-type E3 ligase via the ubiquitin proteasome system.</p>

Above- and belowground controls on water use by trees of different wood types in an eastern US deciduous forest
<p>Stomata control tree transpiration by sensing and integrating environmental signals originating in the atmosphere and soil, and co-occurring species may differ in inherent stomatal sensitivity to these above- and belowground signals and in the types of signals to which they respond. Stomatal responsiveness to environmental signals is likely to differ across species having different types of wood (e.g., ring-porous, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e-porous and coniferous) because each wood type differs in the structure, size and spatial distribution of its xylem conduits as well as in the scaling of hydraulic properties with stem diameter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of variation in soil water availability and atmospheric evaporative demand on stomatal regulation of transpiration in seven co-occurring temperate deciduous forest species representing three wood types. We measured whole-tree sap flux and soil and atmospheric variables in a mixed deciduous forest in central Pennsylvania over the course of a growing season characterized by severe drought and large fluctuations in atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (<i>D</i>). The relative sensitivity of sap flux to soil drying was ∼2.2–2.3 times greater in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e-porous and coniferous species than in the ring-porous species. Stomata of the ring-porous oaks were only about half as responsive to increased <i>D</i> as those of trees of the other two wood types. These differences in responsiveness to changes in the below- and aboveground environment implied that regulation of leaf water potential in the ring-porous oaks was less stringent than that in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e-porous angiosperms or the conifers. The results suggest that increases in the frequency or intensity of summer droughts in the study region could have multiple consequences for forest function, including altered successional time courses or climax species composition and cumulative effects on whole-tree architecture, resulting in a structural and physiological legacy that would restrict the ability of trees to respond rapidly to more favorable growth conditions.</p>

Transcriptional repressor REST drives lineage stage–specific chromatin compaction at <i>Ptch1</i> and increases AKT activation in a mouse model of medulloblastoma
<p>In medulloblastomas (MBs), the expression and activity of RE1-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing transcription factor (REST) is increased in tumors driven by the sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway, specifically the SHH-α (children 3 to 16 years) and SHH-β (infants) subgroups. Neuronal maturation is greater in SHH-β than SHH-α tumors, but both correlate with poor overall patient survival. We studied the contribution of REST to MB using a transgenic mouse model (<i>RESTTG</i><sup></sup>) wherein conditional <i>NeuroD2</i>-controlled <i>REST</i> transgene expression in lineage-committed <i>Ptch1</i><sup>+/−</sup> cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs) accelerated tumorigenesis and increased penetrance and infiltrative disease. This model revealed a neuronal maturation context–specific antagonistic interplay between the transcriptional repressor REST and the activator GLI1 at <i>Ptch1</i>. Expression of <i>Arrb1</i>, which encodes β-arrestin1 (a GLI1 inhibitor), was substantially reduced in proliferating and, to a lesser extent, lineage-committed <i>RESTTG</i><sup></sup> cells compared with wild-type proliferating CGNPs. Lineage-committed <i>REST<sup>TG</sup></i> cells also had decreased GLI1 activity and increased histone H3K9 methylation at the <i>Ptch1</i> locus, which correlated with premature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing of <i>Ptch1</i>.

Expression of <i>PTCH1</i> and <i>GLI1</i> were less, and <i>ARRB1</i> was somewhat greater, in patient SHH-β than SHH-α MBs, whereas that of <i>PTEN</i> was similarly lower in both subtypes than in others. Inhibition of histone modifiers or AKT reduced proliferation and induced apoptosis, respectively, in cultured REST-high MB cells. Our findings linking REST to differentiation-specific chromatin remodeling, <i>PTCH1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing, and AKT activation in MB tissues reveal potential subgroup-specific therapeutic targets for MB patients.</p>

Spin transport in a Mott insulator of ultracold fermions

Improving mechanical sensor performance through larger damping
<p>Mechanical resonances are used in a wide variety of devices, from smartphone accelerometers to computer clocks and from wireless filters to atomic force microscopes. Frequency stability, a critical performance metric, is generally assumed to be tantamount to resonance quality factor (the inverse of the linewidth and of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damp</span></strong>ing). We show that the frequency stability of resonant nanomechanical sensors can be improved by lowering the quality factor. At high bandwidths, quality-factor reduction is completely mitigated by increases in signal-to-noise ratio. At low bandwidths, notably, increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damp</span></strong>ing leads to better stability and sensor resolution, with improvement proportional to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damp</span></strong>ing. We confirm the findings by demonstrating temperature resolution of 60 microkelvin at 300-hertz bandwidth. These results open the door to high-performance ultrasensitive resonators in gaseous or liquid environments, single-cell nanocalorimetry, nanoscale gas chromatography, atmospheric-pressure nanoscale mass spectrometry, and new approaches in crystal oscillator stability.</p>

The piRNA targeting rules and the resistance to piRNA silencing in endogenous genes
<p>Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>e transposons to safeguard genome integrity in animals. However, the functions of the many piRNAs that do not map to transposons remain unknown. Here, we show that piRNA targeting in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> can tolerate a few mismatches but prefer perfect pairing at the seed region. The broad targeting capacity of piRNAs underlies the germline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing of transgenes in <i>C. elegans</i>. Transgenes engineered to avoid piRNA recognition are stably expressed. Many endogenous germline-expressed genes also contain predicted piRNA targeting sites, and periodic An/Tn clusters (PATCs) are an intrinsic signal that provides resistance to piRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing. Together, our study revealed the piRNA targeting rules and highlights a distinct strategy that <i>C. elegans</i> uses to distinguish endogenous from foreign nucleic acids.</p>

Genome-wide identification of interferon-sensitive mutations enables influenza vaccine design
<p>In conventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ated viral vaccines, immunogenicity is often suboptimal. Here we present a systematic approach for vaccine development that eliminates interferon (IFN)–modulating functions genome-wide while maintaining virus replication fitness. We applied a quantitative high-throughput genomics system to influenza A virus that simultaneously measured the replication fitness and IFN sensitivity of mutations across the entire genome. By incorporating eight IFN-sensitive mutations, we generated a hyper–interferon-sensitive (HIS) virus as a vaccine candidate. HIS virus is highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ated in IFN-competent hosts but able to induce transient IFN responses, elicits robust humoral and cellular immune responses, and provides protection against homologous and heterologous viral challenges. Our approach, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ates the virus and promotes immune responses concurrently, is broadly applicable for vaccine development against other pathogens.</p>

The epigenetic control of stemness in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell fate commitment
<p>After priming, naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes establish specific heritable transcription programs that define progression to long-lasting memory cells or to short-lived effector cells. Although lineage specification is critical for protection, it remains unclear how chromatin dynamics contributes to the control of gene expression programs. We explored the role of gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing by the histone methyltransferase Suv39h1. In murine CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells activated after <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> infection, Suv39h1-dependent trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 controls the expression of a set of stem cell–related memory genes. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a defect in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing of stem/memory genes selectively in <i>Suv39h1</i>-defective T cell effectors. As a result, <i>Suv39h1</i>-defective CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells show sustained survival and increased long-term memory reprogramming capacity. Thus, Suv39h1 plays a critical role in marking chromatin to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>e stem/memory genes during CD8<sup>+</sup> T effector terminal differentiation.</p>

Determination of intrinsic attenuation in the oceanic lithosphere-asthenosphere system

The strong intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ation in the asthenosphere obtained at higher frequency (~3 hertz) is comparable to that constrained at lower frequency (~100 seconds) by surface waves and suggests frequency-independent anelasticity, whereas the intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ation in the lithosphere is frequency dependent. This difference in frequency dependence indicates that the strong and broad peak dissipation recently observed in the laboratory exists only in the asthenosphere and provides new insight into what distinguishes the asthenosphere from the lithosphere.</p>

Nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance with chemical resolution
<p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a key analytical technique in chemistry, biology, and medicine. However, conventional NMR spectroscopy requires an at least nanoliter-sized sample volume to achieve sufficient signal. We combined the use of a quantum memory and high magnetic fields with a dedicated quantum sensor based on nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond to achieve chemical shift resolution in <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>19</sup>F NMR spectroscopy of 20-zeptoliter sample volumes. We demonstrate the application of NMR pulse sequences to achieve homonuclear decoupling and spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion measurements.

Aggregation of the Whi3 protein, not loss of heterochromatin, causes sterility in old yeast cells
<p>In yeast, heterochromatin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing is reported to decline in aging mother cells, causing sterility in old cells. This process is thought to reflect a decrease in the activity of the NAD<sup>+ </sup>(oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)–dependent deacetylase Sir2. We tested whether Sir2 becomes nonfunctional gradually or precipitously during aging. Unexpectedly, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing of the heterochromatic <i>HML</i> and <i>HMR</i> loci was not lost during aging. Old cells could initiate a mating response; however, they were less sensitive to mating pheromone than were young cells because of age-dependent aggregation of Whi3, an RNA-binding protein controlling S-phase entry. Removing the polyglutamine domain of Whi3 restored the pheromone sensitivity of old cells. We propose that aging phenotypes previously attributed to loss of heterochromatin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing are instead caused by aggregation of the Whi3 cell cycle regulator.</p>

BRASSINOSTEROID-SIGNALING KINASE5 Associates with Immune Receptors and Is Required for Immune Responses
<p>Plants utilize cell surface-localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect pathogen- or damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMP/DAMPs) and initiate pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). Here, we investigated the role of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) BRASSINOSTEROID-SIGNALING KINASE5 (BSK5), a member of the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase subfamily XII, in PRR-initiated immunity. BSK5 localized to the plant cell periphery, interacted in yeast and in planta with multiple receptor-like kinases, including the ELONGATION FACTOR-TU RECEPTOR (EFR) and PEP1 RECEPTOR1 (PEPR1) PRRs, and was phosphorylated in vitro by PEPR1 and EFR in the kinase activation loop. Consistent with a role in PTI, <i>bsk5</i> mutant plants displayed enhanced susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and to the fungus <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. Furthermore, <i>bsk5</i> mutant plants were impaired in several immune responses induced by the elf18, pep1, and flg22 PAMP/DAMPs, including resistance to <i>P. syringae</i> and <i>B. cinerea</i>, production of reactive oxygen species, callose deposition at the cell wall, and enhanced <i>PATHOGENESIS-RELATED1</i> gene expression. However, <i>bsk5</i> plants were not affected in PAMP/DAMP activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and expression of the <i>FLG22-INDUCED RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1</i> or the WRKY domain-containing gene <i>WRKY29</i>. BSK5 variants mutated in the BSK5 myristoylation site, ATP-binding site, and kinase activation loop failed to complement defective PTI phenotypes of <i>bsk5</i> mutant plants, suggesting that localization to the cell periphery, kinase activity, and phosphorylation by PRRs are critical for the function of BSK5 in PTI. These findings demonstrate that BSK5 plays a role in PTI by interacting with multiple immune receptors.</p>

Aphid-borne Viral Spread Is Enhanced by Virus-induced Accumulation of Plant Reactive Oxygen Species
<p>Most known plant viruses are spread from plant to plant by insect vectors. There is strong evidence that nonpersistently transmitted viruses manipulate the release of plant volatiles to attract insect vectors, thereby promoting virus spread. The mechanisms whereby aphid settling and feeding is altered on plants infected with these viruses, however, are unclear. Here we employed loss-of-function mutations in cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and one of its host plants, tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>), to elucidate such mechanisms. We show that, relative to a CMVΔ2b strain with a deletion of the viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> of RNAi 2b protein in CMV, plants infected with wild-type CMV produce higher concentrations of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in plant tissues. Aphids on wild-type CMV-infected plants engage in shorter probes, less phloem feeding, and exhibit other changes, as detected by electrical penetration graphing technology, relative to CMVΔ2b-infected plants. Therefore, the frequency of virus acquisition and the virus load per aphid were greater on CMV-infected plants than on CMVΔ2b-infected plants. Aphids also moved away from initial feeding sites more frequently on wild-type CMV infected versus CMVΔ2b-infected plants. The role of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in eliciting these effects on aphids was corroborated using healthy plants infused with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Finally, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels were not elevated, and aphid behavior was unchanged, on CMV-infected RbohD-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed tobacco plants, which are deficient in the induction of ROS production. These results suggest that CMV uses its viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> of RNAi protein to increase plant ROS levels, thereby enhancing its acquisition and transmission by vector insects.</p>

Heat Shock Factor HsfA1a Is Essential for <i>R</i> Gene-Mediated Nematode Resistance and Triggers H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Production<sup>1</sup>
<p>Plants generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the apoplast in response to pathogen attack, especially following resistance (<i>R</i>) gene-mediated pathogen recognition; however, the mechanisms activating ROS generation remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that RKN (<i>Meloidogyne incognita</i>) infection rapidly induces ROS accumulation in the roots of tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plants that contain the <i>R</i> gene <i>Mi-1.2</i> but rarely induces ROS accumulation in the susceptible or <i>Mi-1.2</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed resistant genotypes. RNK also induces the hypersensitive response, a form of programmed cell death, in <i>Mi-1.2</i> plants. RKN induces the expression of numerous class-A heat shock factor (HsfA) genes in resistant tomato plants. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing <i>HsfA1a</i> compromises <i>Mi-1.2</i>-mediated resistance, apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation, and the transcription of <i>whitefly induced 1</i> (<i>Wfi1</i>), which encodes a respiratory burst oxidase homolog. HsfA1a regulates <i>Wfi1</i> transcription by binding to the <i>Wfi1</i> promoter, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing of <i>Wfi1</i> compromises <i>Mi-1.2</i>-mediated resistance. HsfA1a and Wfi1 are involved in Mi-1.2-triggered Hsp90 accumulation and basal defense in susceptible tomato. Thus, HsfA–1aWfi1-dependent ROS signaling functions as a crucial regulator of plant defense responses.</p>

Argonaute 8 (AGO8) Mediates the Elicitation of Direct Defenses against Herbivory
<p>In <i>Nicotiana <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ata</i>, specific RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdR1) and the Dicer-like (DCL3 and DCL4) proteins are recruited during herbivore attack to mediate the regulation of defense responses. However, the identity and role(s) of Argonautes (AGOs) involved in herbivory remain unknown. Of the 11 AGOs in the <i>N. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ata</i> genome, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed the expression of 10. Plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed in <i>NaAGO8</i> expression grew normally but were highly susceptible to herbivore attack. Larvae of <i>Manduca sexta</i> grew faster when consuming inverted-repeat stable transformants (ir<i>AGO8</i>) plants but did not differ from the wild type when consuming plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed in <i>AGO1</i> (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i>), <i>AGO2</i>, <i>AGO4</i> (<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>), <i>AGO7</i>, or <i>AGO10</i> expression. ir<i>AGO8</i> plants were significantly compromised in herbivore-induced levels of defense metabolites such as nicotine, phenolamides, and diterpenoid glycosides. Time-course analyses revealed extensively altered microRNA profiles and the reduced accumulation of <i>MYB8</i> transcripts and of the associated genes of the phenolamide and phenylpropanoid pathways as well as the nicotine biosynthetic pathway. A possible AGO8-modulated microRNA-messenger RNA target network was inferred. Furthermore, comparative analysis of domains revealed the diversity of AGO conformations, particularly in the small RNA-binding pocket, which may influence substrate recognition/binding and functional specificity. We infer that AGO8 plays a central role in the induction of direct defenses by modulating several regulatory nodes in the defense signaling network during herbivore response. Thus, our study identifies the effector AGO of the herbivore-induced small RNA machinery, which in <i>N. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ata</i> now comprises RdR1, DCL3/4, and AGO8.</p>

Roles of Dicer-Like Proteins 2 and 4 in Intra- and Intercellular Antiviral Silencing<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing is an innate antiviral mechanism conserved in organisms across kingdoms. Such a cellular defense involves DICER or DICER-LIKEs (DCLs) that process plant virus RNAs into viral small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs). Plants encode four <i>DCLs</i> that play diverse roles in cell-autonomous intracellular virus-induced RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing (known as VIGS) against viral invasion. VIGS can spread between cells. However, the genetic basis and involvement of vsiRNAs in non-cell-autonomous intercellular VIGS remains poorly understood. Using GFP as a reporter gene together with a suite of <i>DCL</i> RNAi transgenic lines, here we show that despite the well-established activities of <i>DCLs</i> in intracellular VIGS and vsiRNA biogenesis, <i>DCL4</i> acts to inhibit intercellular VIGS whereas <i>DCL2</i> is required (likely along with DCL2-processed/dependent vsiRNAs and their precursor RNAs) for efficient intercellular VIGS trafficking from epidermal to adjacent cells. <i>DCL4</i> imposed an epistatic effect on <i>DCL2</i> to impede cell-to-cell spread of VIGS. Our results reveal previously unknown functions for <i>DCL2</i> and <i>DCL4</i> that may form a dual defensive frontline for intra- and intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing to double-protect cells from virus infection in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>.</p>

RXLR Effector AVR2 Up-Regulates a Brassinosteroid-Responsive bHLH Transcription Factor to Suppress Immunity
<p>An emerging area in plant research focuses on antagonism between regulatory systems governing growth and immunity. Such cross talk represents a point of vulnerability for pathogens to exploit. AVR2, an RXLR effector secreted by the potato blight pathogen <i>Phytophthora infestans</i>, interacts with potato BSL1, a putative phosphatase implicated in growth-promoting brassinosteroid (BR) hormone signaling. Transgenic potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) plants expressing the effector exhibit transcriptional and phenotypic hallmarks of overactive BR signaling and show enhanced susceptibility to <i>P. infestans</i>. Microarray analysis was used to identify a set of BR-responsive marker genes in potato, all of which are constitutively expressed to BR-induced levels in AVR2 transgenic lines. One of these genes was a bHLH transcription factor, designated <i>StCHL1</i>, homologous to <i>AtCIB1</i> and <i>AtHBI1</i>, which are known to facilitate antagonism between BR and immune responses. Transient expression of either AVR2 or CHL1 enhanced leaf colonization by <i>P. infestans</i> and compromised immune cell death activated by perception of the elicitin Infestin1 (INF1). Knockdown of <i>CHL1</i> transcript using Virus-Induced Gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing (VIGS) reduced colonization of <i>P. infestans</i> on <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Moreover, the ability of AVR2 to suppress INF1-triggered cell death was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ated in <i>NbCHL1</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed plants, indicating that NbCHL1 was important for this effector activity. Thus, AVR2 exploits cross talk between BR signaling and innate immunity in <i>Solanum</i> species, representing a novel, indirect mode of innate immune suppression by a filamentous pathogen effector.</p>

Cellulose-Derived Oligomers Act as Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns and Trigger Defense-Like Responses
<p>The plant cell wall, often the site of initial encounters between plants and their microbial pathogens, is composed of a complex mixture of cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin polysaccharides as well as proteins. The concept of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) was proposed to describe plant elicitors like oligogalacturonides (OGs), which can be derived by the breakdown of the pectin homogalacturon by pectinases. OGs act via many of the same signaling steps as pathogen- or microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to elicit defenses and provide protection against pathogens. Given both the complexity of the plant cell wall and the fact that many pathogens secrete a wide range of cell wall-degrading enzymes, we reasoned that the breakdown products of other cell wall polymers may be similarly biologically active as elicitors and may help to reinforce the perception of danger by plant cells. Our results indicate that oligomers derived from cellulose are perceived as signal molecules in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), triggering a signaling cascade that shares some similarities to responses to well-known elicitors such as chitooligomers and OGs. However, in contrast to other known PAMPs/DAMPs, cellobiose stimulates neither detectable reactive oxygen species production nor callose deposition. Confirming our idea that both PAMPs and DAMPs are likely to cooccur at infection sites, cotreatments of cellobiose with flg22 or chitooligomers led to synergistic increases in gene expression. Thus, the perception of cellulose-derived oligomers may participate in cell wall integrity surveillance and represents an additional layer of signaling following plant cell wall breakdown during cell wall remodeling or pathogen attack.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p>Oxygen equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand oxygen transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor oxygen binding characteristics and concomitant pH changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of pH and blood pigment saturation in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and recorded changes of pigment oxygenation along oxygen partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and pH gradients to test the setup. Oxygen binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolymph from the cephalopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes oxygen binding with minimal sample consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into oxygen binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

The incidence of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-weighted imaging lesions in the RIPC group (15.87%) was significantly lower than in the sham group (36.51%; relative risk, 0.44; 96% confidence interval, 0.20–0.91; <i>P</i><0.01) and the control group (41.27%; relative risk, 0.39; 96% confidence interval, 0.21–0.82; <i>P</i><0.01). The volumes of lesions were smaller in the RIPC group than in the control and sham groups (<i>P</i><0.01 each). Ischemic events that occurred after CAS were 1 transient ischemic attack in the RIPC group, 2 strokes in the control group, and 2 strokes and 1 transient ischemic attack in the sham group, but these results were not significantly different among the 3 groups (<i>P</i>=0.597).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>RIPC is safe in patients undergoing CAS, which may be able to decrease ischemic brain injury secondary to CAS.

Microstructural Impact of Ischemia and Bone Marrow–Derived Cell Therapy Revealed With Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging Tractography of the Heart In Vivo
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The arrangement of myofibers in the heart is highly complex and must be replicated by injected cells to produce functional myocardium. A novel approach to characterize the microstructural response of the myocardium to ischemia and cell therapy, with the use of serial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion tensor magnetic resonance imaging tractography of the heart in vivo, is presented.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Validation of the approach was performed in normal (n=6) and infarcted mice (n=6) as well as healthy human volunteers. Mice (n=12) were then injected with bone marrow mononuclear cells 3 weeks after coronary ligation. In half of the mice the donor and recipient strains were identical, and in half the strains were different. A positive response to cell injection was defined by a decrease in mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ivity, an increase in fractional anisotropy, and the appearance of new myofiber tracts with the correct orientation. A positive response to bone marrow mononuclear cell injection was seen in 1 mouse. The response of the majority of mice to bone marrow mononuclear cell injection was neutral (9/12) or negative (2/12). The in vivo tractography findings were confirmed with histology.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion tensor magnetic resonance imaging tractography was able to directly resolve the ability of injected cells to generate new myofiber tracts and provided a fundamental readout of their regenerative capacity. A highly novel and translatable approach to assess the efficacy of cell therapy in the heart is thus presented.</p></sec>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Light Signaling-Dependent Regulation of Photoinhibition and Photoprotection in Tomato<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Photoreceptor-mediated light signaling plays a critical role in plant growth, development, and stress responses but its contribution to the spatial regulation of photoinhibition and photoprotection within the canopy remains unclear. Here, we show that low-red/far-red (<i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i>) ratio light conditions significantly alleviate PSII and PSI photoinhibition in the shade leaves of tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plants. This protection is accompanied by a phytochrome A-dependent induction of LONG HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5). HY5 binds to the promoter of <i>ABA INSENSITIVE</i>5 (<i>ABI5</i>), triggering <i>RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG1</i> (<i>RBOH1</i>)-dependent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in the apoplast. Decreased levels of <i>HY5</i>, <i>ABI5</i>, and <i>RBOH1</i> transcripts increased cold-induced photoinhibition and abolished <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i>-induced alleviation of photoinhibition. <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i> illumination induced nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) of chlorophyll <i>a</i> fluorescence and increased the activities of Foyer-Halliwell-Asada cycle enzymes and cyclic electron flux (CEF) around PSI. In contrast, decreased <i>HY5</i>, <i>ABI5</i>, and <i>RBOH1</i> transcript levels abolished the positive effect of <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i> on photoprotection. Loss of <i>PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION5</i>-dependent CEF led to increased photoinhibition and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ated <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i>-dependent NPQ. These data demonstrate that HY5 is an important hub in the cross talk between light and cold response pathways, integrating ABA and reactive oxygen species signaling, leading to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ation of photoinhibition by enhanced induction of photoprotection in shade leaves.</p>
