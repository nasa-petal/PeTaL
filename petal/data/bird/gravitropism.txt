cis-Cinnamic Acid Is a Novel, Natural Auxin Efflux Inhibitor That Promotes Lateral Root Formation
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> steers numerous physiological processes in plants, making the tight control of its endogenous levels and spatiotemporal distribution a necessity. This regulation is achieved by different mechanisms, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthesis, metabolic conversions, degradation, and transport. Here, we introduce cis-cinnamic acid (<i>c</i>-CA) as a novel and unique addition to a small group of endogenous molecules affecting in planta <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> concentrations. <i>c-CA</i> is the photo-isomerization product of the phenylpropanoid pathway intermediate trans-CA (<i>t</i>-CA). When grown on <i>c</i>-CA-containing medium, an evolutionary diverse set of plant species were shown to exhibit phenotypes characteristic for high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> levels, including inhibition of primary root growth, induction of root hairs, and promotion of adventitious and lateral rooting. By molecular docking and receptor binding assays, we showed that <i>c</i>-CA itself is neither an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> nor an anti-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> profiling data revealed that <i>c</i>-CA does not significantly interfere with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthesis. Single cell-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> accumulation assays showed that <i>c</i>-CA, and not <i>t</i>-CA, is a potent inhibitor of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling reporters detected changes in spatiotemporal distribution of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> response along the root of <i>c</i>-CA-treated plants, and long-distance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport assays showed no inhibition of rootward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport. Overall, these results suggest that the phenotypes of <i>c</i>-CA-treated plants are the consequence of a local change in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> accumulation, induced by the inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux. This work reveals a novel mechanism how plants may regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> levels and adds a novel, naturally occurring molecule to the chemical toolbox for the studies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> homeostasis.</p>

Modulation of Auxin Signaling and Development by Polyadenylation Machinery
<p>Polyadenylation influences gene expression by affecting mRNA stability, transport, and translatability. Here, we report that Cleavage stimulation Factor 77 (AtCstF77), a component of the pre-mRNA 3′-end polyadenylation machinery, affects polyadenylation site (PAS) selection in transcripts of some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling genes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Disruption of <i>AtCstF77</i> reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> sensitivity and decreased the expression of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> reporter <i>DR5</i>-<i>GFP</i>. Null mutations of <i>cstf77</i> caused severe developmental defects, but were not lethal as previously reported. <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> genetically interacted with <i>transport inhibitor response 1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling f</i>-<i>box 2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> receptor double mutants, further supporting that polyadenylation affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling. <i>AtCstF77</i> was ubiquitously expressed in embryos, seedlings, and adult plants. The AtCstF77 protein was localized in the nucleus, which is consistent with its function in pre-mRNA processing. We observed that PASs in transcripts from approximately 2,400 genes were shifted in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. Moreover, most of the PAS shifts were from proximal to distal sites. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> treatment also caused PAS shifts in transcripts from a small number of genes. Several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling or homeostasis genes had different PASs in their transcripts in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. The expression levels of <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> RESISTANT 2</i>/<i>INDOLE</i>-<i>3</i>-<i>ACETIC ACID 7</i> were significantly increased in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant, which can partially account for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> resistance phenotype of this mutant. Our results demonstrate that AtCstF77 plays pleiotropic and critical roles in Arabidopsis development. Moreover, disruption of AtCstF64, another component of the polyadenylation machinery, led to developmental defects and reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> response, similar to those of the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. We conclude that AtCstF77 affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> responses, likely by controlling PAS selection of transcripts of some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling components.</p>

Auxin Efflux Carrier ZmPGP1 Mediates Root Growth Inhibition under Aluminum Stress
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> has been shown to enhance root growth inhibition under aluminum (Al) stress in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> may play a negative role in the Al-induced inhibition of root growth. In this study, we identified mutants deficient in the maize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux carrier P-glycoprotein (ZmPGP1) after ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis and used them to elucidate the contribution of ZmPGP1 to Al-induced root growth inhibition. Root growth in the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutant, which forms shortened roots and is hyposensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>, was less inhibited by Al stress than that in the inbred line B73. In the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutants, the root tips displayed higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> accumulation and enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling under Al stress, which was also consistent with the increased expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-responsive genes. Based on the behavior of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-responsive marker transgene, <i>DR5rev:RFP</i>, we concluded that Al stress reduced the level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> in the root tip, which contrasts with the tendency of Al stress-induced Arabidopsis plants to accumulate more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> in their root tips. In addition, Al stress induced the expression of <i>ZmPGP1</i>. Therefore, in maize, Al stress is associated with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> accumulation in root tips, a process that is regulated by ZmPGP1 and thus causes inhibition of root growth. This study provides further evidence about the role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> polar transport in Al-induced root growth regulation in maize.</p>

Initial Bud Outgrowth Occurs Independent of Auxin Flow from Out of Buds
<p>Apical dominance is the process whereby the shoot tip inhibits the growth of axillary buds along the stem. It has been proposed that the shoot tip, which is the predominant source of the plant hormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>, prevents bud outgrowth by suppressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> canalization and export from axillary buds into the main stem. In this theory, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> flow out of axillary buds is a prerequisite for bud outgrowth, and buds are triggered to grow by an enhanced proportional flow of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> from the buds. A major challenge of directly testing this model is in being able to create a bud- or stem-specific change in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport. Here we evaluate the relationship between specific changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux from axillary buds and bud outgrowth after shoot tip removal (decapitation) in the pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport inhibitor 1-<i>N</i>-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) and to a lesser extent, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> perception inhibitor <i>p</i>-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid (PCIB), effectively blocked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux from axillary buds of intact and decapitated plants without affecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> flow in the main stem. Gene expression analyses indicate that NPA and PCIB regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-inducible, and biosynthesis and transport genes, in axillary buds within 3 h after application. These inhibitors had no effect on initial bud outgrowth after decapitation or cytokinin (benzyladenine; BA) treatment. Inhibitory effects of PCIB and NPA on axillary bud outgrowth only became apparent from 48 h after treatment. These findings demonstrate that the initiation of decapitation- and cytokinin-induced axillary bud outgrowth is independent of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> canalization and export from the bud.</p>

Pinstatic Acid Promotes Auxin Transport by Inhibiting PIN Internalization
<p>Polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport plays a pivotal role in plant growth and development. PIN-FORMED (PIN) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux carriers regulate directional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> movement by establishing local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> maxima, minima, and gradients that drive multiple developmental processes and responses to environmental signals. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> has been proposed to modulate its own transport by regulating subcellular PIN trafficking via processes such as clathrin-mediated PIN endocytosis and constitutive recycling. Here, we further investigated the mechanisms by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> affects PIN trafficking by screening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> analogs and identified pinstatic acid (PISA) as a positive modulator of polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). PISA had an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-like effect on hypocotyl elongation and adventitious root formation via positive regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport. PISA did not activate SCF<sup>TIR1/AFB</sup> signaling and yet induced PIN accumulation at the cell surface by inhibiting PIN internalization from the plasma membrane. This work demonstrates PISA to be a promising chemical tool to dissect the regulatory mechanisms behind subcellular PIN trafficking and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport.</p>

Cytokinin-Auxin Crosstalk in the Gynoecial Primordium Ensures Correct Domain Patterning<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) gynoecium consists of two congenitally fused carpels made up of two lateral valve domains and two medial domains, which retain meristematic properties and later fuse to produce the female reproductive structures vital for fertilization. Polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport (PAT) is important for setting up distinct apical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling domains in the early floral meristem remnants allowing for lateral domain identity and outgrowth. Crosstalk between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> and cytokinin plays an important role in the development of other meristematic tissues, but hormone interaction studies to date have focused on more accessible later-stage gynoecia and the spatiotemporal interactions pivotal for patterning of early gynoecium primordia remain unknown. Focusing on the earliest stages, we propose a cytokinin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> feedback model during early gynoecium patterning and hormone homeostasis. Our results suggest that cytokinin positively regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling in the incipient gynoecial primordium and strengthen the concept that cytokinin regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> homeostasis during gynoecium development. Specifically, medial cytokinin promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthesis components [<i>YUCCA1</i>/<i>4</i> (<i>YUC1</i>/<i>4</i>)] in, and PINFORMED7 (PIN7)-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux from, the medial domain. The resulting laterally focused <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling triggers <i>ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE PHOSPHOTRANSFER PROTEIN6</i> (<i>AHP6</i>), which then represses cytokinin signaling in a PAT-dependent feedback. Cytokinin also down-regulates PIN3, promoting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> accumulation in the apex. The <i>yuc1</i>, <i>yuc4</i>, and <i>ahp6</i> mutants are hypersensitive to exogenous cytokinin and 1-napthylphthalamic acid (NPA), highlighting their role in mediolateral gynoecium patterning. In summary, these mechanisms self-regulate cytokinin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling domains, ensuring correct domain specification and gynoecium development.</p>

Protoplast Swelling and Hypocotyl Growth Depend on Different Auxin Signaling Pathways
<p>Members of the TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE1/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> SIGNALING F-BOX PROTEIN (TIR1/AFB) family are known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> receptors. To analyze the possible receptor function of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> BINDING PROTEIN1 (ABP1), an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> receptor currently under debate, we performed different approaches. We performed a pharmacological approach using α-(2,4-dimethylphenylethyl-2-oxo)-indole-3-acetic acid (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>ole), α-(phenylethyl-2-oxo)-indole-3-acetic acid (PEO-IAA), and 5-fluoroindole-3-acetic acid (5-F-IAA) to discriminate between ABP1- and TIR1/AFB-mediated processes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We used a peptide of the carboxyl-terminal region of AtABP1 as a tool. We performed mutant analysis with the null alleles of <i>ABP1</i>, <i>abp1-c1</i> and <i>abp1-TD1</i>, and the TILLING mutant <i>abp1-5</i>. We employed Coimbra, an accession that exhibits an amino acid exchange in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-binding domain of ABP1. We measured either volume changes of single hypocotyl protoplasts or hypocotyl growth, both at high temporal resolution. 5-F-IAA selectively activated the TIR1/AFB pathway but did not induce protoplast swelling; instead, it showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> activity in the hypocotyl growth test. In contrast, PEO-IAA induced an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-like swelling response but no hypocotyl growth. The carboxyl-terminal peptide of AtABP1 induced an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-like swelling response. In the <i>ABP1</i>-related mutants and Coimbra, no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-induced protoplast swelling occurred. ABP1 seems to be involved in mediating rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-induced protoplast swelling, but it is not involved in the control of rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-induced growth.</p>

Primitive Auxin Response without TIR1 and Aux/IAA in the Charophyte Alga <i>Klebsormidium nitens</i>
<p>The phytohormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> regulates many aspects of growth and development in land plants, but the origin and evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling and response mechanisms remain largely unknown. Indeed, it remains to be investigated whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-related pathways diverged before the emergence of land plants. To address this knowledge deficit, we analyzed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> responses in the charophyte alga <i>Klebsormidium nitens</i> NIES-2285, whose ancestor diverged from a green algal ancestor during the evolution of land plants. This strain is the same as <i>Klebsormidium flaccidum</i> NIES-2285, for which the draft genome was sequenced in 2014, and was taxonomically reclassified as <i>K. nitens</i>. This genome sequence revealed genes involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> responses. Furthermore, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) was detected in cultures of <i>K. nitens</i>, but <i>K. nitens</i> lacks the central regulators of the canonical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-signaling pathway found in land plants. Exogenous IAA inhibited cell division and cell elongation in <i>K. nitens</i>. Inhibitors of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthesis and of polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport also inhibited cell division and elongation. Moreover, exogenous IAA rapidly induced expression of a LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN transcription factor. These results suggest that <i>K. nitens</i> has acquired the part of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> system that regulates transcription and cell growth without the requirement for the central players that govern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling in land plants.</p>

Root Gravitropism Is Regulated by a Crosstalk between <i>para</i>-Aminobenzoic Acid, Ethylene, and Auxin
<p>Plants respond to gravitational force through directional growth along the gravity vector. Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> is the central component of the root graviresponse, it works in concert with other plant hormones. Here, we show that the folate precursor <i>para</i>-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is a key modulator of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-ethylene interplay during root gravi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tropism</span></strong> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In gravistimulated roots, PABA promotes an asymmetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> response, which causes the asymmetric growth responsible for root curvature. This activity requires the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> response transcription factors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7) and ARF19 as well as ethylene biosynthesis and signaling, indicating that PABA activity requires both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> and ethylene pathways. Similar to ethylene, exogenous PABA reverses the agravitropic root growth of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport mutant <i>pin-formed2</i> (<i>pin2</i>) and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthetic double mutant with loss of function of <i>weak ethylene insensitive</i> (<i>wei</i>) genes, <i>wei8wei2</i>, but not the <i>pin2wei8wei2</i> triple mutant. This finding suggests that PABA regulates the ethylene-dependent reciprocal compensation between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport and biosynthesis. Furthermore, manipulation of endogenous free PABA levels by modulating the expression of the gene encoding its glucosylation enzyme, UDP-GLYCOSYL TRANSFERASE75B1, impacts the root graviresponse, suggesting that endogenous free PABA levels may play a crucial role in modulating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-ethylene cross talk necessary for root gravi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tropism</span></strong>.</p>

Jasmonic Acid Inhibits Auxin-Induced Lateral Rooting Independently of the CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 Receptor
<p>Plant root systems are indispensable for water uptake, nutrient acquisition, and anchoring plants in the soil. Previous studies using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> inhibitors definitively established that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> plays a central role regulating root growth and development. Most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> inhibitors affect all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling at the same time, which obscures an understanding of individual events. Here, we report that jasmonic acid (JA) functions as a lateral root (LR)-preferential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> inhibitor in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) in a manner that is independent of the JA receptor, CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1). Treatment of wild-type Arabidopsis with either (−)-JA or (+)-JA reduced primary root length and LR number; the reduction of LR number was also observed in <i>coi1</i> mutants. Treatment of seedlings with (−)-JA or (+)-JA suppressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-inducible genes related to LR formation, diminished accumulation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> reporter <i>DR5::GUS</i>, and inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-dependent DII-VENUS degradation. A structural mimic of (−)-JA and (+)-coronafacic acid also inhibited LR formation and stabilized DII-VENUS protein. COI1-independent activity was retained in the double mutant of <i>transport inhibitor response1</i> and <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling f-box protein2</i> (<i>tir1 afb2</i>) but reduced in the <i>afb5</i> single mutant. These results reveal JAs and (+)-coronafacic acid to be selective counter-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>s, a finding that could lead to new approaches for studying the mechanisms of LR formation.</p>

Constitutive Expression of Arabidopsis <i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA19</i> (<i>SAUR19</i>) in Tomato Confers Auxin-Independent Hypocotyl Elongation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>) mediates the elongation growth of shoot tissues by promoting cell expansion. According to the acid growth theory proposed in the 1970s, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> activates plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases (PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases) to facilitate cell expansion by both loosening the cell wall through acidification and promoting solute uptake. Mechanistically, however, this process is poorly understood. Recent findings in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) have demonstrated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-induced <i>SMALL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> UP RNA</i> (<i>SAUR</i>) genes promote elongation growth and play a key role in PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activation by inhibiting PP2C.D family protein phosphatases. Here, we extend these findings by demonstrating that SAUR proteins also inhibit tomato PP2C.D family phosphatases and that AtSAUR19 overexpression in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) confers the same suite of phenotypes as previously reported for Arabidopsis. Furthermore, we employ a custom image-based method for measuring hypocotyl segment elongation with high resolution and a method for measuring cell wall mechanical properties, to add mechanistic details to the emerging description of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-mediated cell expansion. We find that constitutive expression of GFP-AtSAUR19 bypasses the normal requirement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> for elongation growth by increasing the mechanical extensibility of excised hypocotyl segments. In contrast, hypocotyl segments overexpressing a PP2C.D phosphatase are specifically impaired in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-mediated elongation. The time courses of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-induced <i>SAUR</i> expression and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-dependent elongation growth were closely correlated. These findings indicate that induction of <i>SAUR</i> expression is sufficient to elicit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-mediated expansion growth by activating PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases to facilitate apoplast acidification and mechanical wall loosening.</p>

MtLAX2, a Functional Homologue of the Arabidopsis Auxin Influx Transporter AUX1, Is Required for Nodule Organogenesis
<p>Most legume plants can form nodules, specialized lateral organs that form on roots, and house nitrogen-fixing bacteria collectively called rhizobia. The uptake of the phytohormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> into cells is known to be crucial for development of lateral roots. To test the role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> influx in nodulation we used the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> influx inhibitors 1-naphthoxyacetic acid (1-NOA) and 2-NOA, which we found reduced nodulation of <i>Medicago truncatula.</i> This suggested the possible involvement of the AUX/LAX family of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> influx transporters in nodulation. Gene expression studies identified <i>MtLAX2</i>, a paralogue of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>AUX1</i>, as being induced at early stages of nodule development. <i>MtLAX2</i> is expressed in nodule primordia, the vasculature of developing nodules, and at the apex of mature nodules. The <i>MtLAX2</i> promoter contains several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> response elements, and treatment with indole-acetic acid strongly induces <i>MtLAX2</i> expression in roots. <i>mtlax2</i> mutants displayed root phenotypes similar to Arabidopsis <i>aux1</i> mutants, including altered root gravi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tropism</span></strong>, fewer lateral roots, shorter root hairs, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> resistance. In addition, the activity of the synthetic DR5-GUS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> reporter was strongly reduced in <i>mtlax2</i> roots. Following inoculation with rhizobia, <i>mtlax2</i> roots developed fewer nodules, had decreased DR5-GUS activity associated with infection sites, and had decreased expression of the early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> responsive gene <i>ARF16a</i>. Our data indicate that MtLAX2 is a functional analog of Arabidopsis AUX1 and is required for the accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> during nodule formation in tissues underlying sites of rhizobial infection.</p>

In this study, we have identified a mutant, <i>shade avoidance 4</i> (<i>sav4</i>), defective in shade-induced hypocotyl elongation and basipetal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport. <i>SAV4</i> encodes an unknown protein with armadillo repeat- and tetratricopeptide repeat-like domains known to provide protein-protein interaction surfaces. C terminally yellow fluorescent protein-tagged SAV4 localizes to both the plasma membrane and the nucleus. Membrane-localized SAV4 displays a polar association with the shootward plasma membrane domain in hypocotyl and root cells, which appears to be necessary for its function in hypocotyl elongation. Cotransfection of SAV4 and ATP-binding cassette B1 (ABCB1) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transporter in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) revealed that SAV4 blocks ABCB1-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux. We thus propose that polarly localized SAV4 acts to inhibit ABCB-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux toward shoots and facilitates the establishment of proper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> gradients.</p>

LEAFY Controls Auxin Response Pathways in Floral Primordium Formation
<sec><title>Signals to Blossom</title><p>In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, the transcription factor LEAFY (LFY) stimulates flower development, and the formation of floral and leaf primordial tissue is stimulated by the hormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>. Li <i>et al</i>. identified a genetic interaction between LFY and the kinase PINOID, which regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport and the localization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling. In plants null for <i>lfy</i>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling in the developing floral tissue was reduced despite increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> concentration and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthesis. LFY inhibited the expression of genes encoding enzymes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthetic pathway. Reporter analysis of plants with various genetic mutations indicated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling preceded and stimulated LFY production in developing flowers. Thus, there is complex interplay, involving feedback loops, between transcriptional and hormonal regulation of flower development.</p></sec>

RopGEF1 Plays a Critical Role in Polar Auxin Transport in Early Development
<p>Polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport, facilitated by the combined activities of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> influx and efflux carriers to maintain asymmetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> distribution, is essential for plant growth and development. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>RopGEF1</i>, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor and activator of Rho GTPases of plants (ROPs), is critically involved in polar distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> influx carrier AUX1 and differential accumulation of efflux carriers PIN7 and PIN2 and is important for embryo and early seedling development when RopGEF1 is prevalently expressed. Knockdown or knockout of <i>RopGEF1</i> induces embryo defects, cotyledon vein breaks, and delayed root gravity responses. Altered expression from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> response reporter <i>DR5rev:GFP</i> in the root pole of <i>RopGEF1</i>-deficient embryos and loss of asymmetric distribution of <i>DR5rev:GFP</i> in their gravistimulated root tips suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> distribution is affected in <i>ropgef1</i> mutants. This is reflected by the polarity of AUX1 being altered in <i>ropgef1</i> embryos and roots, shifting from the normal apical membrane location to a basal location in embryo central vascular and root protophloem cells and also reduced PIN7 accumulation at embryos and altered PIN2 distribution in gravistimulated roots of mutant seedlings. In establishing that RopGEF1 is critical for AUX1 localization and PIN differential accumulation, our results reveal a role for RopGEF1 in cell polarity and polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport whereby it imapcts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-mediated plant growth and development.</p>

Auxin Function in the Brown Alga <i>Dictyota dichotoma</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> controls body plan patterning in land plants and has been proposed to play a similar role in the development of brown algae (Phaeophyta) despite their distant evolutionary relationship with land plants. The mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> action in brown algae remains controversial because of contradicting conclusions derived from pharmacological studies on <i>Fucus</i>. In this study, we used <i>Dictyota</i> <i>dichotoma</i> as a model system to show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> plays a role during the apical-basal patterning of the embryo of brown algae. Indole-3-acetic acid was detectable in <i>D. dichotoma</i> germlings and mature tissue. Although two-celled <i>D. dichotoma</i> zygotes normally develop a rhizoid from one pole and a thallus meristem from the other, addition of exogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>s to one-celled embryos affected polarization, and both poles of the spheroidal embryo developed into rhizoids instead. The effect was strongest at lower pH and when variable extrinsic informational cues were applied. 2-[4-(diethylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoyl]benzoic acid, an inhibitor of the ABC-B/multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein subfamily of transporters in land plants, affected rhizoid formation by increasing rhizoid branching and inducing ectopic rhizoids. An in silico survey of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> genes suggested that a diverse range of biosynthesis genes and transport genes, such as PIN-LIKES, and the ATP-binding cassette subfamily (ABC-B/multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein) transporters from land plants have homologs in <i>D. dichotoma</i> and <i>Ectocarpus siliculosus</i>. Together with reports on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> function in basal lineages of green algae, these results suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> function predates the divergence between the green and brown lineage and the transition toward land plants.</p>

The ARF7 and ARF19 Transcription Factors Positively Regulate <i>PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1</i> in Arabidopsis Roots
<p>PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1 (PHR1) is a key regulatory component of the response to phosphate (Pi) starvation. However, the regulation of <i>PHR1</i> in this response remains poorly understood. Here, we report that <i>PHR1</i> is a target of the transcription factors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7) and ARF19 and is positively regulated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) roots. <i>PHR1</i> expression was induced by exogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> and suppressed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport inhibitors in Arabidopsis roots. In the <i>PHR1</i> promoter, three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-response elements, which are bound directly by ARF7 and ARF19, were shown to be essential for <i>PHR1</i> expression. The <i>arf7</i>, <i>arf19</i>, and <i>arf7 arf19</i> mutants showed down-regulated expression of <i>PHR1</i> and downstream Pi starvation-induced genes in roots; they also exhibited defective Pi uptake in roots and overaccumulation of anthocyanin in shoots. The induction of lateral root formation in response to low Pi and to exogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> was decreased in the <i>phr1</i> mutant, whereas the expression of <i>LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN16</i> (<i>LBD16</i>) and <i>LBD29</i> was not changed significantly. PHR1 acted independently of LBD16 and LBD29 in the regulation of lateral root formation in response to low Pi. Under low-Pi conditions, lateral root impairment in the <i>arf7 arf19</i> mutant was partially rescued by constitutive expression of <i>PHR1</i>, demonstrating that reduced <i>PHR1</i> expression contributed to the <i>arf7 arf19</i> phenotype. In addition to <i>PHR1</i>, other genes encoding MYB-CC members also were targets of ARF7 and ARF19. Our work thus reveals a mechanism coordinating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling and the PHR1 regulon in Arabidopsis responses to Pi deficiency.</p>

Boron Alleviates Aluminum Toxicity by Promoting Root Alkalization in Transition Zone via Polar Auxin Transport
<p>Boron (B) alleviates aluminum (Al) toxicity in higher plants; however, the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unknown. Here, we used bromocresol green pH indicator, noninvasive microtest, and microelectrode ion flux estimation techniques to demonstrate that B promotes root surface pH gradients in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) roots, leading to alkalization in the root transition zone and acidification in the elongation zone, while Al inhibits these pH gradients. B significantly decreased Al accumulation in the transition zone (∼1.0–2.5 mm from the apex) of lateral roots, thereby alleviating Al-induced inhibition of root elongation. Net indole acetic acid (IAA) efflux detected by an IAA-sensitive platinum microelectrode showed that polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport, which peaked in the root transition zone, was inhibited by Al toxicity, while it was partially recovered by B. Electrophysiological experiments using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transporter mutants (<i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> resistant1-7</i>; <i>pin-formed2</i> [<i>pin2</i>]) and the specific polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transporter inhibitor1-naphthylphthalamic acid showed that PIN2-based polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport is involved in root surface alkalization in the transition zone. Our results suggest that B promotes polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport driven by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux transporter PIN2 and leads to the downstream regulation of the plasma membrane-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, resulting in elevated root surface pH, which is essential to decrease Al accumulation in this Al-targeted apical root zone. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of exogenous B in alleviation of Al accumulation and toxicity in plants.</p>

The sHSP22 Heat Shock Protein Requires the ABI1 Protein Phosphatase to Modulate Polar Auxin Transport and Downstream Responses
<p>The phytohormones abscisic acid (ABA) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) response pathways interact synergistically or antagonistically to regulate plant development and environmental adaptation. Here, we show that <i>ABI1</i>, a key negative regulator of ABA signaling, is essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-modulated root development. We performed a microarray analysis using the loss-of-function mutant <i>abi1-3</i> and Col-0 seedlings treated with IAA. For <i>sHSP22</i>, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) small heat shock protein-encoding gene, the induction by IAA was dependent on <i>ABI1</i>. <i>shsp22</i> displayed enhanced sensitivity to ABA in primary root growth. In contrast, overexpression of full-length, but not truncated sHSP22 lacking signal peptide and ER-retention sequences, resulted in decreased ABA sensitivity. Overexpressed (OX) <i>sHSP22</i> partially rescued the ABA hypersensitivity of <i>abi1-3</i>. In addition, <i>sHSP22</i> is involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-regulated hypocotyl elongation at high temperature treatment. <i>sHSP22</i> also affected accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux carrier PIN proteins due to potentiated intracellular trafficking. And <i>sHSP22 OX</i> lines initiated more lateral roots after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> application. Our results suggest that sHSP22 regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> response through modulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> polar transport, and ABI1-sHSP22 provides a novel module orchestrating ABA and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling crosstalk in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

Developmental Programming of Thermonastic Leaf Movement
<p>Plants exhibit diverse polar behaviors in response to directional and nondirectional environmental signals, termed tropic and nastic movements, respectively. The ways in which plants incorporate directional information into tropic behaviors is well understood, but it is less well understood how nondirectional stimuli, such as ambient temperatures, specify the polarity of nastic behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that a developmentally programmed polarity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> flow underlies thermo-induced leaf hyponasty in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In warm environments, PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) stimulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> production in the leaf. This results in the accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> in leaf petioles, where PIF4 directly activates a gene encoding the PINOID (PID) protein kinase. PID is involved in polarization of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transporter PIN-FORMED3 to the outer membranes of petiole cells. Notably, the leaf polarity-determining ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS1) directs the induction of <i>PID</i> to occur predominantly in the abaxial petiole region. These observations indicate that the integration of PIF4-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthesis and polar transport, and the AS1-mediated developmental shaping of polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> flow, coordinate leaf thermonasty, which facilitates leaf cooling in warm environments. We believe that leaf thermonasty is a suitable model system for studying the developmental programming of environmental adaptation in plants.</p>

Three Auxin Response Factors Promote Hypocotyl Elongation
<p>The hormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> regulates growth largely by affecting gene expression. By studying Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants deficient in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> RESPONSE FACTORS (ARFs), we have identified three ARF proteins that are required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-responsive hypocotyl elongation. Plants deficient in these factors have reduced responses to environmental conditions that increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> levels, including far-red-enriched light and high temperature. Despite having decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> responses, the ARF-deficient plants responded to brassinosteroid and gibberellin, indicating that different hormones can act partially independently. Aux/IAA proteins, encoded by <i>IAA</i> genes, interact with ARF proteins to repress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> response. Silencing expression of multiple <i>IAA</i> genes increased hypocotyl elongation, suggesting that Aux/IAA proteins modulate ARF activity in hypocotyls in a potential negative feedback loop.</p>

The <i>MicroRNA390</i>/<i>TRANS-ACTING SHORT INTERFERING RNA3</i> Module Mediates Lateral Root Growth under Salt Stress via the Auxin Pathway
<p>Salt-induced developmental plasticity in a plant root system strongly depends on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling. However, the molecular events underlying this process are poorly understood. <i>MicroRNA390</i> (<i>miR390</i>), <i>trans-actin small interfering RNA</i>s (<i>tasiRNA</i>s), and <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> RESPONSE FACTORs</i> (<i>ARFs</i>) form a regulatory module involved in controlling lateral root (LR) growth. Here, we found that <i>miR390</i> expression was strongly induced by exposure to salt during LR formation in poplar (<i>Populus</i> spp.) plants. <i>miR390</i> overexpression stimulated LR development and increased salt tolerance, whereas <i>miR390</i> knockdown caused by a short tandem target mimic repressed LR growth and compromised salt resistance. <i>ARF3.1</i>, <i>ARF3.2</i>, and <i>ARF4</i> expression was inhibited significantly by the presence of salt, and transcript abundance was decreased dramatically in the <i>miR390</i>-overexpressing line but increased in the <i>miR390</i>-knockdown line. Constitutive expression of <i>ARF4m</i> harboring mutated <i>trans-acting small interfering ARF</i>-binding sites removed the salt resistance of the <i>miR390</i> overexpressors. <i>miR390</i> positively regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling in LRs subjected to salt, but <i>ARF4</i> inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling. Salinity stabilized the poplar Aux/IAA repressor INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID17.1, and overexpression of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>/salt-resistant form of this repressor suppressed LR growth in <i>miR390</i>-overexpressing and <i>ARF4</i>-RNA interfering lines in the presence of salt. Thus, the <i>miR390/TAS3/ARFs</i> module is a key regulator, via modulating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> pathway, of LR growth in poplar subjected to salt stress.</p>

Type B Response Regulators Act As Central Integrators in Transcriptional Control of the Auxin Biosynthesis Enzyme TAA1
<p>During embryogenesis and organ formation, establishing proper gradient is critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> function, which is achieved through coordinated regulation of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> metabolism and transport. Expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthetic genes is often tissue specific and is regulated by environmental signals. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of a key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthetic gene, <sc>l</sc>-Tryptophan aminotransferase of Arabidopsis1 (<i>TAA1</i>). A canonical and a novel Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) response regulator (ARR) binding site were identified in the promoter and the second intron of <i>TAA1</i>, which were required for its tissue-specific expression. C-termini of a subset of the type B ARRs selectively bind to one or both cis elements and activate the expression of <i>TAA1</i>. We further demonstrated that the ARRs not only mediate the transcriptional regulation of <i>TAA1</i> by cytokinins, but also mediate its regulation by ethylene, light, and developmental signals. Through direct protein-protein interactions, the transcriptional activity of ARR1 is enhanced by ARR12, DELLAs, and ethylene-insenstive3 (EIN3). Our study thus revealed the ARR proteins act as key node that mediate the regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthesis by various hormonal, environmental, and developmental signals through transcriptional regulation of the key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthesis gene <i>TAA1</i>.</p>

A DII Domain-Based Auxin Reporter Uncovers Low Auxin Signaling during Telophase and Early G1
<p>A sensitive and dynamically responsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling reporter based on the DII domain of the INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID28 (IAA28, DII) protein from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) was modified for use in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). The DII domain was fused to a yellow fluorescent protein and a nuclear localization sequence to simplify quantitative nuclear fluorescence signal. DII degradation dynamics provide an estimate of input signal into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling pathway that is influenced by both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> accumulation and F-box coreceptor concentration. In maize, the DII-based marker responded rapidly and in a dose-dependent manner to exogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> via proteasome-mediated degradation. Low levels of DII-specific fluorescence corresponding to high endogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling occurred near vasculature tissue and the outer layer and glume primordia of spikelet pair meristems and floral meristems, respectively. In addition, high DII levels were observed in cells during telophase and early G1, suggesting that low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling at these stages may be important for cell cycle progression.</p>

Mitochondrial Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Contributes to Auxin-Regulated Organ Development
<p>Pyruvate dehydrogenase is the first enzyme (E1) of the PDH complex (PDC). This multienzyme complex contains E1, E2, and E3 components and controls the entry of carbon into the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle to enable cellular energy production. The E1 component of the PDC is composed of an E1α catalytic subunit and an E1β regulatory subunit. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), there are two mitochondrial E1α homologs encoded by <i>IAA-CONJUGATE-RESISTANT 4</i> (<i>IAR4</i>) and <i>IAR4-LIKE</i> (<i>IAR4L</i>), and one mitochondrial E1β homolog. Although IAR4 was reported to be involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> conjugate sensitivity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> homeostasis in root development, its precise role remains unknown. Here, we provide experimental evidence that mitochondrial PDC E1 contributes to polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport during organ development. We performed genetic screens for factors involved in cotyledon development and identified an uncharacterized mutant, <i>macchi-bou 1</i> (<i>mab1</i>). <i>MAB1</i> encodes a mitochondrial PDC E1β subunit that can form both a homodimer and a heterodimer with IAR4. The <i>mab1</i> mutation impaired MAB1 homodimerization, reduced the abundance of IAR4 and IAR4L, weakened PDC enzymatic activity, and diminished mitochondrial respiration. A metabolomics analysis showed significant changes in metabolites including amino acids in <i>mab1</i> and, in particular, identified an accumulation of Ala. These results suggest that MAB1 is a component of the Arabidopsis mitochondrial PDC E1. Furthermore, in <i>mab1</i> mutants and seedlings where the TCA cycle was pharmacologically blocked, we found reduced abundance of the PIN-FORMED (PIN) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux carriers, possibly due to impaired PIN recycling and enhanced PIN degradation in vacuoles. Therefore, we suggest that <i>mab1</i> induces defective polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport via metabolic abnormalities.</p>

Evidence for Exaptation of the <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i> M20D Peptidase MpILR1 into the Tracheophyte Auxin Regulatory Pathway
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> homeostasis is tightly regulated by several mechanisms, including conjugation of the hormone to specific moieties, such as amino acids or sugar. The inactive phytohormone conjugate is stored in large pools in plants and hydrolyzed to regain full activity. Many conjugate hydrolases (M20D metallopeptidases) have been identified and characterized throughout the plant kingdom. We have traced this regulatory gene family back to liverwort (<i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>), a member of the most ancient extant land plant lineage, which emerged approximately 475 million years ago. We have isolated and characterized a single hydrolase homologue, dubbed <i>M. polymorpha</i> IAA-Leucine Resistant1 (MpILR1), from liverwort. MpILR1 can hydrolyze two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> (indole acetic acid [IAA]) substrates (IAA-Leucine and IPA-Alanine) at very low levels of activity, but it cannot hydrolyze the two native <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> conjugates of liverwort (IAA-Glycine and IAA-Valine). We conclude from these results that liverwort likely does not employ active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> conjugate hydrolysis as a regulatory mechanism and that conjugate homeostasis likely takes place in liverwort by passive background degradation. Furthermore, we present evidence that MpILR1 was probably exapted by tracheophytes over evolutionary time into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> regulatory pathway.</p>

SELF-PRUNING Acts Synergistically with DIAGEOTROPICA to Guide Auxin Responses and Proper Growth Form
<p>The <i>SELF PRUNING</i> (<i>SP</i>) gene is a key regulator of growth habit in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>). It is an ortholog of <i>TERMINAL FLOWER1</i>, a phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein with antiflorigenic activity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A spontaneous loss-of-function mutation (<i>sp</i>) has been bred into several industrial tomato cultivars, as it produces a suite of pleiotropic effects that are favorable for mechanical harvesting, including determinate growth habit, short plant stature, and simultaneous fruit ripening. However, the physiological basis for these phenotypic differences has not been thoroughly explained. Here, we show that the <i>sp</i> mutation alters polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport as well as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> responses, such as gravitropic curvature and elongation of excised hypocotyl segments. We also demonstrate that free <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> levels and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-regulated gene expression patterns are altered in <i>sp</i> mutants. Furthermore, <i>diageotropica</i>, a mutation in a gene encoding a cyclophilin A protein, appears to confer epistatic effects with <i>sp</i>. Our results indicate that SP affects the tomato growth habit at least in part by influencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport and responsiveness. These findings suggest potential novel targets that could be manipulated for controlling plant growth habit and improving productivity.</p>

Auxin and ROP GTPase Signaling of Polar Nuclear Migration in Root Epidermal Hair Cells
<p>Polar nuclear migration is crucial during the development of diverse eukaryotes. In plants, root hair growth requires polar nuclear migration into the outgrowing hair. However, knowledge about the dynamics and the regulatory mechanisms underlying nuclear movements in root epidermal cells remains limited. Here, we show that both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> and Rho-of-Plant (ROP) signaling modulate polar nuclear position at the inner epidermal plasma membrane domain oriented to the cortical cells during cell elongation as well as subsequent polar nuclear movement to the outer domain into the emerging hair bulge in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling via the nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7)/ARF19 and INDOLE ACETIC ACID7 pathway ensures correct nuclear placement toward the inner membrane domain. Moreover, precise inner nuclear placement relies on SPIKE1 Rho-GEF, SUPERCENTIPEDE1 Rho-GDI, and ACTIN7 (ACT7) function and to a lesser extent on VTI11 vacuolar SNARE activity. Strikingly, the directionality and/or velocity of outer polar nuclear migration into the hair outgrowth along actin strands also are ACT7 dependent, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> sensitive, and regulated by ROP signaling. Thus, our findings provide a founding framework revealing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> and ROP signaling of inner polar nuclear position with some contribution by vacuolar morphology and of actin-dependent outer polar nuclear migration in root epidermal hair cells.</p>

Root Bending Is Antagonistically Affected by Hypoxia and ERF-Mediated Transcription via Auxin Signaling
<p>When plants encounter soil water logging or flooding, roots are the first organs to be confronted with reduced gas diffusion resulting in limited oxygen supply. Since roots do not generate photosynthetic oxygen, they are rapidly faced with oxygen shortage rendering roots particularly prone to damage. While metabolic adaptations to low oxygen conditions, which ensure basic energy supply, have been well characterized, adaptation of root growth and development have received less attention. In this study, we show that hypoxic conditions cause the primary root to grow sidewise in a low oxygen environment, possibly to escape soil patches with reduced oxygen availability. This growth behavior is reversible in that gravitropic growth resumes when seedlings are returned to normoxic conditions. Hypoxic root bending is inhibited by the group VII ethylene response factor (ERFVII) RAP2.12, as <i>rap2.12-1</i> seedlings show exaggerated primary root bending. Furthermore, overexpression of the ERFVII member <i>HRE2</i> inhibits root bending, suggesting that primary root growth direction at hypoxic conditions is antagonistically regulated by hypoxia and hypoxia-activated ERFVIIs. Root bending is preceded by the establishment of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> gradient across the root tip as quantified with DII-VENUS and is synergistically enhanced by hypoxia and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport inhibitor naphthylphthalamic acid. The protein abundance of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux carrier PIN2 is reduced at hypoxic conditions, a response that is suppressed by RAP2.12 overexpression, suggesting antagonistic control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> flux by hypoxia and ERFVII. Taken together, we show that hypoxia triggers an escape response of the primary root that is controlled by ERFVII activity and mediated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling in the root tip.</p>

The Auxin Biosynthetic <i>TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE RELATED TaTAR2.1-3A</i> Increases Grain Yield of Wheat
<p>Controlling the major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthetic pathway to manipulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> content could be a target for genetic engineering of crops with desired traits, but little progress had been made because low or high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> contents often cause developmental inhibition. Here, we performed a genome-wide analysis of bread wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) to identify the Tryptophan Aminotransferase of Arabidopsis1/Tryptophan Aminotransferase-Related (TAA1/TAR) genes that function in the tryptophan-dependent pathway of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthesis. Sequence mining together with gene cloning identified 15 <i>TaTAR</i> genes, among which 12 and three genes were phylogenetically close to Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) AtTAR2 and AtTAR3, respectively. <i>TaTAR2.1</i> had the most abundant transcripts in the <i>TaTAR2</i> genes and was expressed mainly in roots and up-regulated by low nitrogen (N) availability. Knockdown of <i>TaTAR2.1</i> caused vegetative and reproductive deficiencies and impaired lateral root (LR) growth under both high- and low-N conditions. Overexpressing <i>TaTAR2.1-3A</i> in wheat enhanced LR branching, plant height, spike number, grain yield, and aerial N accumulation under different N supply levels. In addition, overexpressing <i>TaTAR2.1-3A</i> in Arabidopsis elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> accumulation in the primary root tip, LR tip, LR primordia, and cotyledon and hypocotyl and increased primary root length, visible LR number, and shoot fresh weight under high- and low-N conditions. Our results indicate that <i>TaTAR2.1</i> is critical for wheat growth and also shows potential for genetic engineering to reach the aim of improving the grain yield of wheat.</p>

Shoot Removal Induces Chloroplast Development in Roots via Cytokinin Signaling
<p>The development of plant chloroplasts is regulated by various developmental, environmental, and hormonal cues. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), chloroplast development is repressed in roots via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling. However, roots develop chloroplasts when they are detached from the shoot. In contrast to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>, cytokinin positively affects chloroplast development in roots, but the role and signaling pathway of cytokinin in the root greening response remain unclear. To understand the regulatory pathways of chloroplast development in the plant stress response, we examined the mechanisms underlying the conditional greening of detached roots. In wild-type Arabidopsis roots, shoot removal activates type B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR (ARR)-mediated cytokinin signaling and induces chlorophyll accumulation and photosynthetic remodeling. ARR1 and ARR12 are essential for up-regulating nucleus- and plastid-encoded genes associated with chloroplast development in detached roots. In this process, WOUND INDUCED DEDIFFERENTIATION1 and class B GATA transcription factors (B-GATAs) act upstream and downstream of ARRs, respectively. Overexpression of B-GATAs promotes root greening, as does shoot removal, dependent on a light signaling transcription factor, LONG HYPOCOTYL5. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> represses the root greening response independent of ARR signaling. <i>GNC-LIKE</i> (<i>GNL</i>), a B-GATA, is strongly up-regulated in detached roots via ARR1 and ARR12 but is repressed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>, so <i>GNL</i> may function at the point of convergence of cytokinin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling in the root greening response.</p>

Unusual Roles of Secretory SNARE SYP132 in Plasma Membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Traffic and Vegetative Plant Growth
<p>The plasma membrane proton (H<sup>+</sup>)-ATPases of plants generate steep electrochemical gradients and activate osmotic solute uptake. H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase-mediated proton pumping orchestrates cellular homeostasis and is a prerequisite for plastic cell expansion and plant growth. All evidence suggests that the population of H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase proteins at the plasma membrane reflects a balance of their roles in exocytosis, endocytosis, and recycling. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> governs both traffic and activation of the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase proteins already present at the membrane. As in other eukaryotes, in plants, SNARE-mediated membrane traffic influences the density of several proteins at the plasma membrane. Even so, H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase traffic, its relationship with SNAREs, and its regulation by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> have remained enigmatic. Here, we identify the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) Qa-SNARE SYP132 (Syntaxin of Plants132) as a key factor in H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase traffic and demonstrate its association with endocytosis. SYP132 is a low-abundant, secretory SNARE that primarily localizes to the plasma membrane. We find that <i>SYP132</i> expression is tightly regulated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> and that augmented SYP132 expression reduces the amount of H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase proteins at the plasma membrane. The physiological consequences of SYP132 overexpression include reduced apoplast acidification and suppressed vegetative growth. Thus, SYP132 plays unexpected and vital roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-regulated H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase traffic and associated functions at the plasma membrane.</p>

The Role of Auxin in the Pattern Formation of the Asteraceae Flower Head (Capitulum)
<p>Nature often creates complex structures by rearranging pre-existing units. One such example is the flower head (capitulum) in daisies, where a group of flowers (florets) and phyllaries (modified bracts) are arranged to superficially mimic a single flower. The capitulum is a key taxonomical innovation that defines the daisy family (Asteraceae), the largest flowering plant group. However, patterning mechanisms underlying its structure remain elusive. Here, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>, a plant hormone, provides a developmental patterning cue for the capitulum. During capitulum development, a temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> gradient occurs, regulating the successive and centripetal formation of distinct florets and phyllaries. Disruption of the endogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> gradient led to homeotic conversions of florets and phyllaries in the capitulum. Furthermore, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> regulates floral meristem identity genes, such as <i>Matricaria inodora RAY2</i> and <i>M</i>. <i>inodora LEAFY</i>, which determine floret and phyllary identity. This study reveals the mechanism of capitulum patterning and highlights how common developmental tools, such as hormone gradients, have independently evolved in plants and animals.</p>

Auxin Contributes to the Intraorgan Regulation of Gene Expression in Response to Shade
<p>Plants sense and respond to light via multiple photoreceptors including phytochrome. The decreased ratio of red to far-red light that occurs under a canopy triggers shade-avoidance responses, which allow plants to compete with neighboring plants. The leaf acts as a photoperceptive organ in this response. In this study, we investigated how the shade stimulus is spatially processed within the cotyledon. We performed transcriptome analysis on microtissue samples collected from vascular and nonvascular regions of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) cotyledons. In addition, we mechanically isolated and analyzed the vascular tissue. More genes were up-regulated by the shade stimulus in vascular tissues than in mesophyll and epidermal tissues. The genes up-regulated in the vasculature were functionally divergent and included many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-responsive genes, suggesting that various physiological/developmental processes might be controlled by shade stimulus in the vasculature. We then investigated the spatial regulation of these genes in the vascular tissues. A small vascular region within a cotyledon was irradiated with far-red light, and the response was compared with that when the whole seedling was irradiated with far-red light. Most of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-responsive genes were not fully induced by the local irradiation, suggesting that perception of the shade stimulus requires that a wider area be exposed to far-red light or that a certain position in the mesophyll and epidermis of the cotyledon be irradiated. This result was consistent with a previous report that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> synthesis genes are up-regulated in the periphery of the cotyledon. Hence, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> acts as an important intraorgan signaling factor that controls the vascular shade response within the cotyledon.</p>

Jasmonic Acid Enhances Al-Induced Root Growth Inhibition<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Phytohormones such as ethylene and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> are involved in the regulation of the aluminum (Al)-induced root growth inhibition. Although jasmonate (JA) has been reported to play a crucial role in the regulation of root growth and development in response to environmental stresses through interplay with ethylene and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>, its role in the regulation of root growth response to Al stress is not yet known. In an attempt to elucidate the role of JA, we found that exogenous application of JA enhanced the Al-induced root growth inhibition. Furthermore, phenotype analysis with mutants defective in either JA biosynthesis or signaling suggests that JA is involved in the regulation of Al-induced root growth inhibition. The expression of the JA receptor CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) and the key JA signaling regulator MYC2 was up-regulated in response to Al stress in the root tips. This process together with COI1-mediated Al-induced root growth inhibition under Al stress was controlled by ethylene but not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that many responsive genes under Al stress were regulated by JA signaling. The differential responsive of microtubule organization-related genes between the wild-type and <i>coi1-2</i> mutant is consistent with the changed depolymerization of cortical microtubules in <i>coi1</i> under Al stress. In addition, ALMT-mediated malate exudation and thus Al exclusion from roots in response to Al stress was also regulated by COI1-mediated JA signaling. Together, this study suggests that root growth inhibition is regulated by COI1-mediated JA signaling independent from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling and provides novel insights into the phytohormone-mediated root growth inhibition in response to Al stress.</p>

OsPINOID Regulates Stigma and Ovule Initiation through Maintenance of the Floral Meristem by Auxin Signaling
<p>Stigma and ovule initiation is essential for sexual reproduction in flowering plants. However, the mechanism underlying the initiation of stigma and ovule primordia remains elusive. We identified a stigma-less mutant of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and revealed that it was caused by the mutation in the <i>PINOID</i> (<i>OsPID</i>) gene. Unlike the <i>pid</i> mutant that shows typical pin-like inflorescences in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the <i>ospid</i> mutant does not display any defects in inflorescence development and flower initiation, and fails to develop normal ovules in most spikelets. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> activity in the young pistil of <i>ospid</i> was lower than that in the wild-type pistil. Furthermore, the expression of most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> response factor genes was down-regulated, and <i>OsETTIN1</i>, <i>OsETTIN2</i>, and <i>OsMONOPTEROS</i> lost their rearrangements of expression patterns during pistil and stamen primordia development in <i>ospid</i>. Moreover, the transcription of the floral meristem marker gene, <i>OSH1</i>, was down-regulated and <i>FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER4</i>, the putative ortholog of Arabidopsis <i>CLAVATA3</i>, was up-regulated in the pistil primordium of <i>ospid</i>. These results suggested that the meristem proliferation in the pistil primordium might be arrested prematurely in <i>ospid</i>. Based on these results, we propose that the OsPID-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the regulation of rice stigma and ovule initiation by maintaining the floral meristem.</p>

The OsFBK1 E3 Ligase Subunit Affects Anther and Root Secondary Cell Wall Thickenings by Mediating Turnover of a Cinnamoyl-CoA Reductase
<p>Regulated proteolysis by the ubiquitin-26S proteasome system challenges transcription and phosphorylation in magnitude and is one of the most important regulatory mechanisms in plants. This article describes the characterization of a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-responsive Kelch-domain-containing F-box protein, OsFBK1, found to be a component of an SCF E3 ligase by interaction studies in yeast. Rice transgenics of <i>OsFBK1</i> displayed variations in anther and root secondary cell wall content; it could be corroborated by electron/confocal microscopy and lignification studies, with no apparent changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> content/signaling pathway. The presence of U-shaped secondary wall thickenings (or lignin) in the anthers were remarkably less pronounced in plants overexpressing <i>OsFBK1</i> as compared to wild-type and knockdown transgenics. The roots of the transgenics also displayed differential accumulation of lignin. Yeast two-hybrid anther library screening identified an OsCCR that is a homolog of the well-studied Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) IRX4; OsFBK1-OsCCR interaction was confirmed by fluorescence and immunoprecipitation studies. Degradation of OsCCR mediated by SCF<sup>OsFBK1</sup> and the 26S proteasome pathway was validated by cell-free experiments in the absence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>, indicating that the phenotype observed is due to the direct interaction between OsFBK1 and OsCCR. Interestingly, the <i>OsCCR</i> knockdown transgenics also displayed a decrease in root and anther lignin depositions, suggesting that OsFBK1 plays a role in the development of rice anthers and roots by regulating the cellular levels of a key enzyme controlling lignification.</p>

Converging Light, Energy and Hormonal Signaling Control Meristem Activity, Leaf Initiation, and Growth<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>The development of leaf primordia is subject to light control of meristematic activity. Light regulates the expression of thousands of genes with roles in cell proliferation, organ development, and differentiation of photosynthetic cells. Previous work has highlighted roles for hormone homeostasis and the energy-dependent Target of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase in meristematic activity, yet a picture of how these two regulatory mechanisms depend on light perception and interact with each other has yet to emerge. Their relevance beyond leaf initiation also is unclear. Here, we report the discovery that the dark-arrested meristematic region of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) experiences a local energy deprivation state and confirm previous findings that the PIN1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transporter is diffusely localized in the dark. Light triggers a rapid removal of the starvation state and the establishment of PIN1 polar membrane localization consistent with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> export, both preceding the induction of cell cycle- and cytoplasmic growth-associated genes. We demonstrate that shoot meristematic activity can occur in the dark through the manipulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> and cytokinin activity as well as through the activation of energy signaling, both targets of photomorphogenesis action, but the organ developmental outcomes differ: while TOR-dependent energy signals alone stimulate cell proliferation, the development of a normal leaf lamina requires photomorphogenesis-like hormonal responses. We further show that energy signaling adjusts the extent of cell cycle activity and growth of young leaves non-cellautonomously to available photosynthates and leads to organs constituted of a greater number of cells developing under higher irradiance. This makes energy signaling perhaps the most important biomass growth determinant under natural, unstressed conditions.</p>

LAZY Genes Mediate the Effects of Gravity on Auxin Gradients and Plant Architecture<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>A rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) mutant led to the discovery of a plant-specific LAZY1 protein that controls the orientation of shoots. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) possesses six <i>LAZY</i> genes having spatially distinct expression patterns. Branch angle phenotypes previously associated with single <i>LAZY</i> genes were here studied in roots and shoots of single and higher-order <i>atlazy</i> mutants. The results identify the major contributors to root and shoot branch angles and gravitropic behavior of seedling hypocotyls and primary roots. <i>AtLAZY1</i> is the principal determinant of inflorescence branch angle. The weeping inflorescence phenotype of <i>atlazy1</i>,<i>2</i>,<i>4</i> mutants may be due at least in part to a reversal in the gravi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tropism</span></strong> mechanism. <i>AtLAZY2</i> and <i>AtLAZY4</i> determined lateral root branch angle. Lateral roots of the <i>atlazy2</i>,<i>4</i> double mutant emerged slightly upward, approximately 10° greater than perpendicular to the primary root axis, and they were agravitropic. Etiolated hypocotyls of the quadruple <i>atlazy1</i>,<i>2</i>,<i>3</i>,<i>4</i> mutant were essentially agravitropic, but their phototropic response was robust. In light-grown seedlings, the root of the <i>atlazy2</i>,<i>3</i>,<i>4</i> mutant was also agravitropic but when adapted to dim red light it displayed a reversed gravitropic response. A reversed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> gradient across the root visualized by a fluorescent signaling reporter explained the reversed, upward bending response. We propose that AtLAZY proteins control plant architecture by coupling gravity sensing to the formation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> gradients that override a LAZY-independent mechanism that creates an opposing gravity-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> gradient.</p>

Linking Auxin with Photosynthetic Rate via Leaf Venation
<p>Land plants lose vast quantities of water to the atmosphere during photosynthetic gas exchange. In angiosperms, a complex network of veins irrigates the leaf, and it is widely held that the density and placement of these veins determines maximum leaf hydraulic capacity and thus maximum photosynthetic rate. This theory is largely based on interspecific comparisons and has never been tested using vein mutants to examine the specific impact of leaf vein morphology on plant water relations. Here we characterize mutants at the <i>Crispoid</i> (<i>Crd</i>) locus in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>), which have altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> homeostasis and activity in developing leaves, as well as reduced leaf vein density and aberrant placement of free-ending veinlets. This altered vein phenotype in <i>crd</i> mutant plants results in a significant reduction in leaf hydraulic conductance and leaf gas exchange. We find <i>Crispoid</i> to be a member of the <i>YUCCA</i> family of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthetic genes. Our results link <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthesis with maximum photosynthetic rate through leaf venation and substantiate the theory that an increase in the density of leaf veins coupled with their efficient placement can drive increases in leaf photosynthetic capacity.</p>

Gene Regulation by the AGL15 Transcription Factor Reveals Hormone Interactions in Somatic Embryogenesis
<p>The MADS box transcription factor Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>AGAMOUS-LIKE15</i> (<i>AGL15</i>) and a putative ortholog from soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), <i>GmAGL15</i>, are able to promote somatic embryogenesis (SE) in these plants when ectopically expressed. SE is an important means of plant regeneration, but many plants, or even particular cultivars, are recalcitrant for this process. Understanding how (Gm)AGL15 promotes SE by identifying and characterizing direct and indirect downstream regulated genes can provide means to improve regeneration by SE for crop improvement and to perform molecular tests of genes. Conserved transcription factors and the genes they regulate in common between species may provide the most promising avenue to identify targets for SE improvement. We show that (Gm)AGL15 negatively regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling in both Arabidopsis and soybean at many levels of the pathway, including the repression of <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> RESPONSE FACTOR6</i> (<i>ARF6</i>) and <i>ARF8</i> and <i>TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE1</i> as well as the indirect control of components via direct expression of a microRNA-encoding gene. We demonstrate interaction between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> and gibberellic acid in the promotion of SE and document an inverse correlation between bioactive gibberellic acid and SE in soybean, a difficult crop to transform. Finally, we relate hormone accumulation to transcript accumulation of important soybean embryo regulatory factors such as ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3 and FUSCA3 and provide a working model of hormone and transcription factor interaction in the control of SE.</p>

A Transcription Factor, OsMADS57, Regulates Long-Distance Nitrate Transport and Root Elongation
<p>Root nitrate uptake adjusts to the plant’s nitrogen demand for growth. Here, we report that OsMADS57, a MADS-box transcription factor, modulates nitrate translocation from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) roots to shoots under low-nitrate conditions. <i>OsMADS57</i> is abundantly expressed in xylem parenchyma cells of root stele and is induced by nitrate. Compared with wild-type rice plants supplied with 0.2 mM nitrate, <i>osmads57</i> mutants had 31% less xylem loading of nitrate, while overexpression lines had 2-fold higher levels. Shoot-root <sup>15</sup>N content ratios were 40% lower in the mutants and 76% higher in the overexpression lines. Rapid NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> root influx experiments showed that mutation of <i>OsMADS57</i> did not affect root nitrate uptake. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR analysis of <i>OsNRT2</i> nitrate transporter genes showed that after 5 min in 0.2 mM nitrate, only <i>OsNRT2.3a</i> (a vascular-specific high-affinity nitrate transporter) had reduced (by two-thirds) expression levels. At 60 min of nitrate treatment, lower expression levels were also observed for three additional <i>NRT2</i> genes (<i>OsNRT2.1/2.2/2.4</i>). Conversely, in the overexpression lines, four <i>NRT2</i> genes had much higher expression profiles at all time points tested. As previously reported, <i>OsNRT2.3a</i> functions in nitrate translocation, indicating the possible interaction between <i>OsMADS57</i> and <i>OsNRT2.3a</i>. Yeast one-hybrid and transient expression assays demonstrated that OsMADS57 binds to the CArG motif (CATTTTATAG) within the <i>OsNRT2.3a</i> promoter. Moreover, seminal root elongation was inhibited in <i>osmads57</i> mutants, which may be associated with higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> levels in and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> polar transport to root tips of mutant plants. Taken together, these results suggest that OsMADS57 has a role in regulating nitrate translocation from root to shoot via OsNRT2.3a.</p>

A Mobile Auxin Signal Connects Temperature Sensing in Cotyledons with Growth Responses in Hypocotyls
<p>Plants have a remarkable capacity to adjust their growth and development to elevated ambient temperatures. Increased elongation growth of roots, hypocotyls, and petioles in warm temperatures are hallmarks of seedling thermomorphogenesis. In the last decade, significant progress has been made to identify the molecular signaling components regulating these growth responses. Increased ambient temperature utilizes diverse components of the light sensing and signal transduction network to trigger growth adjustments. However, it remains unknown whether temperature sensing and responses are universal processes that occur uniformly in all plant organs. Alternatively, temperature sensing may be confined to specific tissues or organs, which would require a systemic signal that mediates responses in distal parts of the plant. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings show organ-specific transcriptome responses to elevated temperatures and that thermomorphogenesis involves both autonomous and organ-interdependent temperature sensing and signaling. Seedling roots can sense and respond to temperature in a shoot-independent manner, whereas shoot temperature responses require both local and systemic processes. The induction of cell elongation in hypocotyls requires temperature sensing in cotyledons, followed by the generation of a mobile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signal. Subsequently, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> travels to the hypocotyl, where it triggers local brassinosteroid-induced cell elongation in seedling stems, which depends upon a distinct, permissive temperature sensor in the hypocotyl.</p>

Both the <i>mir167a</i> mutant and the <i>ARF</i> overexpression lines were defective in anther dehiscence and ovule development. Serendipitously, we found that the <i>mir167a</i> (♀) × wild type (♂) crosses failed to produce normal embryos and endosperms, despite the findings that embryos with either <i>mir167a<sup>+/−</sup></i> or <i>mir167a<sup>−/−</sup></i> genotypes developed normally when <i>mir167a<sup>+/−</sup></i> plants were self-pollinated, revealing a central role of <i>MIR167A</i> in maternal control of seed development. The <i>mir167a</i> phenotype is 100% penetrant, providing a great genetic tool for studying the roles of miRNAs and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> in maternal control. Moreover, we found that <i>mir167a</i> mutants flowered significantly later than wild-type plants, a phenotype that was not observed in the <i>ARF</i> overexpression lines. We show that the reproductive defects of <i>mir167a</i> mutants were suppressed by a decrease of activities of <i>ARF6</i>, <i>ARF8</i>, or both. Our results clearly demonstrate that <i>MIR167A</i> is the predominant <i>MIR167</i> member in regulating Arabidopsis reproduction and that <i>MIR167A</i> acts as a maternal gene that functions largely through <i>ARF6</i> and <i>ARF8</i>.</p>

Evidence for the Regulation of Gynoecium Morphogenesis by <i>ETTIN</i> via Cell Wall Dynamics
<p><i>ETTIN</i> (<i>ETT</i>) is an atypical member of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> RESPONSE FACTOR family of transcription factors that plays a crucial role in tissue patterning in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) gynoecium. Though recent insights have provided valuable information on ETT’s interactions with other components of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling, the biophysical mechanisms linking ETT to its ultimate effects on gynoecium morphology were until now unknown. Here, using techniques to assess cell-wall dynamics during gynoecium growth and development, we provide a coherent body of evidence to support a model in which ETT controls the elongation of the valve tissues of the gynoecium through the positive regulation of pectin methylesterase (PME) activity in the cell wall. This increase in PME activity results in an increase in the level of demethylesterified pectins and a consequent reduction in cell wall stiffness, leading to elongation of the valves. Though similar biophysical mechanisms have been shown to act in the stem apical meristem, leading to the expansion of organ primordia, our findings demonstrate that regulation of cell wall stiffness through the covalent modification of pectin also contributes to tissue patterning within a developing plant organ.</p>

Cytokinin Targets Auxin Transport to Promote Shoot Branching
<p>Cytokinin promotes shoot branching by activating axillary buds, but its mechanism of action in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) in this process is unclear. We have shown previously that a hextuple mutant lacking a clade of type-A Arabidopsis Response Regulators (ARRs) known to act in cytokinin signaling has reduced shoot branching compared with the wild type. Since these proteins typically act as negative regulators of cytokinin signaling, this is an unexpected result. To explore this paradox more deeply, we characterized the effects of loss of function of the type-B ARR, ARR1, which positively regulates cytokinin-induced gene expression. The <i>arr1</i> mutant has increased branching, consistent with a role antagonistic to the type-A ARRs but in apparent conflict with the known positive role for cytokinin in bud activation. We show that the <i>arr</i> branching phenotypes correlate with increases in stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport and steady-state levels of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> export proteins PIN3 and PIN7 on the plasma membrane of xylem-associated cells in the main stem. Cytokinin treatment results in an increased accumulation of PIN3, PIN7, and the closely related PIN4 within several hours, and loss of <i>PIN3</i>, <i>PIN4</i>, and <i>PIN7</i> can partially rescue the <i>arr1</i> branching phenotype. This suggests that there are multiple signaling pathways for cytokinin in bud outgrowth; one of these pathways regulates PIN proteins in shoots, independently of the canonical signaling function of the <i>ARR</i> genes tested here. A hypothesis consistent with the <i>arr</i> shoot phenotypes is that feedback control of biosynthesis leads to altered cytokinin accumulation, driving cytokinin signaling via this pathway.</p>

Different Modes of Negative Regulation of Plant Immunity by Calmodulin-Related Genes
<p>Plant immune responses activated through the perception of microbe-associated molecular patterns, leading to pattern-triggered immunity, are tightly regulated. This results in low immune responses in the absence of pathogens and a rapid return to the resting state following an activation event. Here, we show that two <i>CALMODULIN-LIKE</i> genes, <i>CML46</i> and <i>CML47</i>, negatively regulate salicylic acid accumulation and immunity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The double mutant <i>cml46 cml47</i> is highly resistant to the pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>maculicola</i> (<i>Pma</i>). The effects of <i>cml46 cml47</i> on <i>Pma</i> growth are genetically additive to that of <i>cbp60a</i>, a known negative regulator in the <i>CALMODULIN-BINDING PROTEIN60</i> (<i>CBP60</i>) family. Transcriptome profiling revealed the effects of <i>cbp60a</i> and <i>cml46 cml47</i> on both common and separate sets of genes, with the majorities of these differentially expressed genes being <i>Pma</i> responsive. <i>CBP60g</i>, a positive regulator of immunity in the <i>CBP60</i> family, was found to be transcriptionally regulated by <i>CBP60a</i>, <i>CML46</i>, and <i>CML47</i>. Analysis of the flg22-induced mRNA levels of <i>CBP60g</i> in <i>cbp60a</i> and <i>cml46 cml47</i> revealed that <i>cml46 cml47</i> plants have higher induced expression while <i>cbp60a</i> plants retain elevated levels longer than wild-type plants. Assays for the effect of flg22 treatment on <i>Pma</i> growth showed that the effect is stronger in <i>cml46 cml47</i> plants and lasts longer in <i>cbp60a</i> plants. Thus, the expression pattern of <i>CBP60g</i> is reflected in flg22-induced resistance to <i>Pma</i>.</p>

TCP Transcription Factors Regulate Shade Avoidance via Directly Mediating the Expression of Both <i>PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR</i>s and Auxin Biosynthetic Genes
<p>Light quality surrounding a plant is largely determined by the density of its neighboring vegetation. Plants are able to sense shade light signals and initiate a series of adaptation responses, which is known as shade avoidance syndrome (SAS). PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) are key factors in the SAS network by regulating the biosynthesis of multiple phytohormones and the expression of cell expansion genes. Although the protein levels of PIFs were found to be acumulated in shade, the transcriptional regulation of <i>PIFs</i> in response to such an environmental signal remains poorly understood. Here we show that TCP17 and its two closely related homologs, TCP5 and TCP13, play an important role in mediating shade-induced hypocotyl elongation by up-regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthesis via a PIF-dependent and a PIF-independent pathway. In constitutive white light, a <i>tcp5, 13, 17</i> triple mutant (<i>3tcp</i>) showed a subtle hypocotyl defective phenotype. In shade, however, <i>3tcp</i> showed a significantly reduced hypocotyl elongation phenotype, indicating a positive role of TCPs in regulating SAS. Our in-depth biochemical and genetic analyses indicated that TCP17 can be significantly accumulated in shade. TCP17 binds to the promoters of <i>PIFs</i> and <i>YUCCAs</i> to indirectly or directly up-regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> levels in shade. These data provide new insights into our better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of SAS in plants.</p>

Regulation of Hormonal Control, Cell Reprogramming, and Patterning during De Novo Root Organogenesis
<p>Body regeneration through formation of new organs is a major question in developmental biology. We investigated de novo root formation using whole leaves of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our results show that local cytokinin biosynthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthesis in the leaf blade followed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> long-distance transport to the petiole leads to proliferation of J0121-marked xylem-associated tissues and others through signaling of INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID INDUCIBLE28 (IAA28), CRANE (IAA18), WOODEN LEG, and ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATORS1 (ARR1), ARR10, and ARR12. Vasculature proliferation also involves the cell cycle regulator KIP-RELATED PROTEIN2 and ABERRANT LATERAL ROOT FORMATION4, resulting in a mass of cells with rooting competence that resembles callus formation. Endogenous callus formation precedes specification of postembryonic root founder cells, from which roots are initiated through the activity of SHORT-ROOT, PLETHORA1 (PLT1), and PLT2. Primordia initiation is blocked in <i>shr plt1 plt2</i> mutant. Stem cell regulators SCHIZORIZA, JACKDAW, BLUEJAY, and SCARECROW also participate in root initiation and are required to pattern the new organ, as mutants show disorganized and reduced number of layers and tissue initials resulting in reduced rooting. Our work provides an organ regeneration model through de novo root formation, stating key stages and the primary pathways involved.</p>

Reassessing the Roles of PIN Proteins and Anticlinal Microtubules during Pavement Cell Morphogenesis
<p>The leaf epidermis is a biomechanical shell that influences the size and shape of the organ. Its morphogenesis is a multiscale process in which nanometer-scale cytoskeletal protein complexes, individual cells, and groups of cells pattern growth and define macroscopic leaf traits. Interdigitated growth of neighboring cells is an evolutionarily conserved developmental strategy. Understanding how signaling pathways and cytoskeletal proteins pattern cell walls during this form of tissue morphogenesis is an important research challenge. The cellular and molecular control of a lobed cell morphology is currently thought to involve PIN-FORMED (PIN)-type plasma membrane efflux carriers that generate subcellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> gradients. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> gradients were proposed to function across cell boundaries to encode stable offset patterns of cortical microtubules and actin filaments between adjacent cells. Many models suggest that long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal cell wall generate local cell wall heterogeneities that restrict local growth and specify the timing and location of lobe formation. Here, we used Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) reverse genetics and multivariate long-term time-lapse imaging to test current cell shape control models. We found that neither PIN proteins nor long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal wall predict the patterns of lobe formation. In fields of lobing cells, anticlinal microtubules are not correlated with cell shape and are unstable at the time scales of cell expansion. Our analyses indicate that anticlinal microtubules have multiple functions in pavement cells and that lobe initiation is likely controlled by complex interactions among cell geometry, cell wall stress patterns, and transient microtubule networks that span the anticlinal and periclinal walls.</p>
