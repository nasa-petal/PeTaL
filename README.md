# PeTaL (Periodic Table of Life)

The Periodic Table of Life (PeTaL, pronounced petal) is a design tool aimed at allowing users to seemlesly move from ideas (from nature or other sources) to design.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project to a production system.  

### Guides 
[Setting up the development environment](https://github.com/nasa/PeTaL/wiki/Setting-up-PeTaL-with-Docker)    

## Contributing

We're using the [Git Feature Branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow), to contribute code to the code base. To summarize, `master` should always contain only stable, tested code. To work on a change, first create a feature branch off of `master`, perform your changes, and when your code is ready, submit a pull request to merge your branch with `master`. 

## Deployment

## Legacy Code

For the Django version as it existed in 2020 see the master legacy-2020 branch.
For Flask version of PeTaL as it existed in 2019, see the /legacy/ directory in the master-legacy-2020 branch.

Since the HTML/CSS/Javascript is similar to what is currently used, and some code is shared, this is kept close-by, potentially serving as a reference for future developers to build upon.

One module in the legacy code, Biomole, makes use of code written by Soren Knudsen. The code is available at
[https://github.com/sknudsen/biomole](https://github.com/sknudsen/biomole).

The code makes use of data from AskNature that is not in the published source due to property rights. 
Instead, you can get the data from the links below to see a working version:
